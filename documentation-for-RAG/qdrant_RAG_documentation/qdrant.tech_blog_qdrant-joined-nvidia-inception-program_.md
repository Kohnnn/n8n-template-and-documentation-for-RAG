Recently we’ve become a member of the NVIDIA Inception. It is a program that helps boost the evolution of technology startups through access to their cutting-edge technology and experts, connects startups with venture capitalists, and provides marketing support.

Along with the various opportunities it gives, we are the most excited about GPU support since it is an essential feature in Qdrant’s roadmap.
Stay tuned for our new updates.
