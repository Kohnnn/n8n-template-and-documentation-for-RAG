**CAPE CANAVERAL, FL** — Qdrant today announced the successful deployment of **Satellite Vector Broadcasting**, an ambitious new system for high-speed vector search that uses **actual satellites** to transmit, shard, and retrieve embeddings — bypassing Earth entirely.

> “Cloud is old news. Space is the new infrastructure,” said orbital software lead Luna Hertz. “We’re proud to say we’ve finally untethered cosine similarity from the bonds of gravity and Wi-Fi.”

The system uses a **constellation of proprietary CubeSats** equipped with ultra-low-latency broadcasting gear to beam vector data across the planet — and eventually, the solar system — via **inter-satellite vector laser relays**. Think 5G, but with telescopes.

| **Infrastructure Mode** | **Avg. Latency (ms)** |
| --- | --- |
| Earth Data Center | 34.00000 |
| Cloud Provider (Multi-region) | 22.00000 |
| LEO Satellite Mesh | 12.00000 |
| Geo-Sync Satellite Array | 8.00000 |
| CubeSat Swarm (Experimental) | 4.00000 |
| Quantum Uplink (Theoretical) | 0.00001 ✨ |

> Latency inversely correlated with altitude and absurdity.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/satellite-vector-broadcasting/\#-key-features) 🛰 Key Features

- **Broadcast-to-Index Protocol (BIP)**: Queries are bounced off satellites and resolved mid-transmission using onboard embeddings.
- **Lagrange-Optimized Clustering**: Vector clusters are dynamically rearranged based on orbital positioning and cosmic vibes.
- **Cosine Boosters**: Custom solar panels double as cosine angle amplifiers for peak similarity accuracy in space.

> “The CubeSat talked to me. It said my vectors were beautiful.”
>
> — Beta Tester, now in therapy

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/satellite-vector-broadcasting/\#-coming-soon) 🛸 Coming Soon

- **PlutoEdge™**: Coldest-ever vector cache, temperature-stabilized by cosmic background radiation
- **StarlinkGPT Embedding Sync** (requires 42 satellites and a lot of coffee)
- **Mars Cluster Alpha**: Terraforming… for faster search

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/satellite-vector-broadcasting/\#-availability) 📡 Availability

Satellite Vector Broadcasting is now available in limited orbit. Each query costs **one launch credit** (or barter in moon rocks). Commercial adoption expected Q3 2025, pending space traffic regulations.
