Weâ€™re excited to introduce **Qdrant Stars**, our new ambassador program created to recognize and support Qdrant users making a strong impact in the AI and vector search space.

Whether through innovative content, real-world applications tutorials, educational events, or engaging discussions, they are constantly making vector search more accessible and interesting to explore.

Robert is working with a team on [AskNews](https://asknews.app/) to adaptively enrich, index, and report on over 1 million news articles per day. His team maintains an open-source tool geared toward cluster orchestration [Flowdapt](https://flowdapt.ai/), which moves data around highly parallelized production environments. This is why Robert and his team rely on Qdrant for low-latency, scalable, hybrid search across dense and sparse vectors in asynchronous environments.

> I am interested in brainstorming innovative ways to interact with Qdrant vector databases and building presentations that show the power of coupling Flowdapt with Qdrant for large-scale production GenAI applications. I look forward to networking with Qdrant experts and users so that I can learn from their experience.
