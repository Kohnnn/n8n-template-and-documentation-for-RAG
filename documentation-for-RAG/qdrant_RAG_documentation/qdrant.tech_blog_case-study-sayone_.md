### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/case-study-sayone/\#the-challenge) The Challenge

SayOne is an information technology and digital services company headquartered in India. They create end-to-end customized digital solutions, and have completed over 200 projects for clients worldwide. When SayOne embarked on building advanced AI solutions for government institutions, their initial choice was Pinecone, primarily due to its prevalence within AI documentation. However, SayOne soon discovered significant limitations impacting their projects. Key challenges included escalating costs, restrictive customization options, and considerable scalability issues. Furthermore, reliance on external cloud infrastructure posed critical data privacy concerns, especially since governmental entities demanded stringent data sovereignty and privacy controls.

Recognizing the importance of overcoming these hurdles, SayOne initiated a thorough evaluation of alternative vector database solutions. The evaluation encompassed Qdrant, Milvus, and Weaviate, with specific attention to cost-efficiency, latency, ease of deployment, scalability, and overall developer experience.

During the rigorous testing phase, Qdrant clearly distinguished itself with superior performance metrics, especially in terms of latency—a critical factor for responsive AI-driven applications. SayOne conducted extensive load testing using real-world scenarios, mimicking production environments, particularly for government clients planning to deploy voice-interactive systems. The previous solution, Pinecone, exhibited high latency largely due to regional cloud server discrepancies. In contrast, Qdrant’s ability to host deployments closer to user locations proved pivotal in achieving significantly reduced latency, enhancing overall responsiveness and reliability.

Another standout advantage was Qdrant’s streamlined and intuitive deployment process. Developers at SayOne highlighted that other evaluated solutions presented substantial deployment complexities, requiring extensive DevOps resources and intricate configurations. Qdrant, however, provided a simplified yet powerful infrastructure, allowing teams to rapidly deploy and scale solutions with minimal friction. The intuitive UI and comprehensive developer tooling offered by Qdrant facilitated easier debugging, enhanced productivity, and a far superior developer experience compared to other platforms.

The versatility of Qdrant was also critically important. SayOne leveraged Qdrant’s robust hybrid search capabilities and advanced payload filtering extensively, significantly improving both the accuracy and speed of search results when integrated with sophisticated re-ranking models like Cohere. These features were instrumental in maintaining high levels of accuracy, crucial for public sector applications where precision and reliability are paramount.

Following the successful deployment of an initial project serving a government, Qdrant quickly became the default vector database solution across various governmental initiatives globally. Notably, clients from Southeast Asia and the Middle East explicitly requested Qdrant, underscoring its strong reputation for data privacy, scalability, and flexibility in supporting both cloud-based and fully on-premise environments.

The impact of adopting Qdrant has been transformative for SayOne. Government clients have benefited from drastically improved latency, robust data sovereignty compliance, and accelerated development cycles. SayOne’s engineers report enhanced productivity, citing Qdrant’s straightforward infrastructure and proactive community support as critical factors in project success.

Overall, Qdrant has empowered SayOne to deliver secure, scalable, and efficient AI-driven solutions tailored explicitly to the stringent requirements of government institutions. By selecting Qdrant, SayOne positioned itself as a reliable technology partner capable of navigating complex AI deployments and satisfying the rigorous demands of global public sector projects.
