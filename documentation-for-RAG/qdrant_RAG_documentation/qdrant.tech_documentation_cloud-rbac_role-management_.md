> üí° You can access this in **Access Management > User & Role Management** _if available see [this page for details](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/)._

A **Role** contains a set of **permissions** that define the ability to perform or control specific actions in Qdrant Cloud. Permissions are accessible through the Permissions tab in the Role Details page and offer fine-grained access control, logically grouped for easy identification.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/role-management/\#built-in-roles) Built-In Roles

Qdrant Cloud includes some built-in roles for common use-cases. The permissions for these built-in roles cannot be changed.

There are three types:

- The **Base Role** is assigned to all users, and provides the minimum privileges required to access Qdrant Cloud.
- The¬†**Admin Role**¬† has all available permissions, except for account write permissions.
- The **Owner Role** has all available permissions assigned, including account write permissions. There can only be one Owner per account currently.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/role-management/\#custom-roles) Custom Roles

An¬†authorized user can create their own custom roles with specific sets of permissions, giving them more control over who has what access to which resource.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/role-management/\#creating-a-custom-role) Creating a Custom Role

To create a new custom role, click on the¬†**Add**¬†button at the top-right corner of the¬†**Custom Roles**¬†list.

- **Role Name**: Must be unique across roles.
- **Role Description**: Brief description of the role‚Äôs purpose.

Once created, the new role will appear under the **Custom Roles** section in the navigation.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/role-management/\#editing-a-custom-role) Editing a Custom Role

To update a specific role‚Äôs permissions, select it from the list and click on the¬†**Permissions**¬†tab. Here, you‚Äôll find logically grouped options that are easy to identify and edit as needed. Once you‚Äôve made your changes, save them to apply the updated permissions to the role.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud-rbac/role-management/\#renaming-deleting-and-duplicating-a-custom-role) Renaming, Deleting and Duplicating a Custom Role

Each custom role can be renamed, duplicated or deleted via the action buttons located to the right of the role title bar.

- **Rename**: Opens a dialog allowing users to update both the role name and description.
- **Delete**: Triggers a confirmation prompt to confirm the deletion. Once confirmed, this action is irreversible. Any users assigned to the deleted role will automatically be unassigned from it.
- **Duplicate:** Opens a dialog asking for a confirmation and also allowing users to view the list of permissions that will be assigned to the duplicated role
