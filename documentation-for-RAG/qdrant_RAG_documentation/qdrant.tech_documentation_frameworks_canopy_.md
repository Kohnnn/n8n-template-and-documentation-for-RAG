# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/canopy/\#pinecone-canopy) Pinecone Canopy

[Canopy](https://github.com/pinecone-io/canopy) is an open-source framework and context engine to build chat assistants at scale.

Qdrant is supported as a knowledge base within Canopy for context retrieval and augmented generation.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/canopy/\#usage) Usage

Install the SDK with the Qdrant extra as described in the [Canopy README](https://github.com/pinecone-io/canopy?tab=readme-ov-file#extras).

```bash
pip install canopy-sdk[qdrant]

```

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/canopy/\#creating-a-knowledge-base) Creating a knowledge base

```python
from canopy.knowledge_base import QdrantKnowledgeBase

kb = QdrantKnowledgeBase(collection_name="<YOUR_COLLECTION_NAME>")

```

To create a new Qdrant collection and connect it to the knowledge base, use the `create_canopy_collection` method:

```python
kb.create_canopy_collection()

```

You can always verify the connection to the collection with the `verify_index_connection` method:

```python
kb.verify_index_connection()

```

Learn more about customizing the knowledge base and its inner components [in the Canopy library](https://github.com/pinecone-io/canopy/blob/main/docs/library.md#understanding-knowledgebase-workings).

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/canopy/\#adding-data-to-the-knowledge-base) Adding data to the knowledge base

To insert data into the knowledge base, you can create a list of documents and use the `upsert` method:

```python
from canopy.models.data_models import Document

documents = [\
    Document(\
        id="1",\
        text="U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976.",\
        source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2",\
    ),\
    Document(\
        id="2",\
        text="Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002.",\
        source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Monkeys",\
        metadata={"my-key": "my-value"},\
    ),\
]

kb.upsert(documents)

```

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/canopy/\#querying-the-knowledge-base) Querying the knowledge base

You can query the knowledge base with the `query` method to find the most similar documents to a given text:

```python
from canopy.models.data_models import Query

kb.query(
    [\
        Query(text="Arctic Monkeys music genre"),\
        Query(\
            text="U2 music genre",\
            top_k=10,\
            metadata_filter={"key": "my-key", "match": {"value": "my-value"}},\
        ),\
    ]
)

```
