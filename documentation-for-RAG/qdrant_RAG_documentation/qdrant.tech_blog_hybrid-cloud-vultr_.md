We’re excited to share that Qdrant and [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) are partnering to provide seamless scalability and performance for vector search workloads. With Vultr’s global footprint and customizable platform, deploying vector search workloads becomes incredibly flexible. Qdrant’s new [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/) offering and its Kubernetes-native design, coupled with Vultr’s straightforward virtual machine provisioning, allows for simple setup when prototyping and building next-gen AI apps.

In the fast-paced world of AI and ML, businesses are eagerly integrating AI and generative AI to enhance their products with new features like AI assistants, develop new innovative solutions, and streamline internal workflows with AI-driven processes. Given the diverse needs of these applications, it’s clear that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t apply to AI development. This variability in requirements underscores the need for adaptable and customizable development environments.

Recognizing this, Qdrant and Vultr have teamed up to offer developers unprecedented flexibility and control. The collaboration enables the deployment of a fully managed vector database on Vultr’s adaptable platform, catering to the specific needs of diverse AI projects. This unique setup offers developers the ideal Vultr environment for their vector search workloads. It ensures seamless adaptability and data privacy with all data residing in their environment. For the first time, Qdrant Hybrid Cloud allows for fully managing a vector database on Vultr, promoting rapid development cycles without the hassle of modifying existing setups and ensuring that data remains secure within the organization. Moreover, this partnership empowers developers with centralized management over their vector database clusters via Qdrant’s control plane, enabling precise size adjustments based on workload demands. This joint setup marks a significant step in providing the AI and ML field with flexible, secure, and efficient application development tools.

> _“Our collaboration with Qdrant empowers developers to unlock the potential of vector search applications, such as RAG, by deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud with its high-performance search capabilities directly on Vultr’s global, automated cloud infrastructure. This partnership creates a highly scalable and customizable platform, uniquely designed for deploying and managing AI workloads with unparalleled efficiency.”_ Kevin Cochrane, Vultr CMO.
