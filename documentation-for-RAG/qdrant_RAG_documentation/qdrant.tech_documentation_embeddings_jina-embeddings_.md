Qdrant is compatible with [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) embeddings. You can get a free trial key from [Jina Embeddings](https://jina.ai/embeddings/) to get embeddings.

Qdrant users can receive a 10% discount on Jina AI APIs by using the code **QDRANT**.

> Jina recommends using `jina-embeddings-v3` for text-only tasks and `jina-clip-v2` for multimodal tasks or when enhanced visual retrieval is required.

On top of the backbone, `jina-embeddings-v3` has been trained with 5 task-specific adapters for different embedding uses. Include `task` in your request to optimize your downstream application:

- **retrieval.query**: Used to encode user queries or questions in retrieval tasks.
- **retrieval.passage**: Used to encode large documents in retrieval tasks at indexing time.
- **classification**: Used to encode text for text classification tasks.
- **text-matching**: Used to encode text for similarity matching, such as measuring similarity between two sentences.
- **separation**: Used for clustering or reranking tasks.

`jina-embeddings-v3` and `jina-clip-v2` support **Matryoshka Representation Learning**, allowing users to control the embedding dimension with minimal performance loss.

Include `dimensions` in your request to select the desired dimension.

By default, **dimensions** is set to 1024, and a number between 256 and 1024 is recommended.

You can reference the table below for hints on dimension vs. performance:

| Dimension | 32 | 64 | 128 | 256 | 512 | 768 | 1024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average Retrieval Performance (nDCG@10) | 52.54 | 58.54 | 61.64 | 62.72 | 63.16 | 63.3 | 63.35 |

`jina-embeddings-v3` supports [Late Chunking](https://jina.ai/news/late-chunking-in-long-context-embedding-models/), the technique to leverage the model‚Äôs long-context capabilities for generating contextual chunk embeddings. Include `late_chunking=True` in your request to enable contextual chunked representation. When set to true, Jina AI API will concatenate all sentences in the input field and feed them as a single string to the model. Internally, the model embeds this long concatenated string and then performs late chunking, returning a list of embeddings that matches the size of the input list.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/jina-embeddings/\#jina-embeddings-v3) Jina Embeddings v3

The code below demonstrates how to use `jina-embeddings-v3` with Qdrant:

```python
import requests

import qdrant_client
from qdrant_client.models import Distance, VectorParams, Batch

# Provide Jina API key and choose one of the available models.
JINA_API_KEY = "jina_xxxxxxxxxxx"
MODEL = "jina-embeddings-v3"
DIMENSIONS = 1024 # Or choose your desired output vector dimensionality.
TASK = 'retrieval.passage' # For indexing, or set to retrieval.query for querying

# Get embeddings from the API
url = "https://api.jina.ai/v1/embeddings"

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {JINA_API_KEY}",
}

data = {
    "input": ["Your text string goes here", "You can send multiple texts"],
    "model": MODEL,
    "dimensions": DIMENSIONS,
    "task": TASK,
    "late_chunking": True,
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
embeddings = [d["embedding"] for d in response.json()["data"]]

# Index the embeddings into Qdrant
client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(":memory:")
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    vectors_config=VectorParams(size= DIMENSIONS, distance=Distance.DOT),
)

qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    points=Batch(
        ids=list(range(len(embeddings))),
        vectors=embeddings,
    ),
)

```

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/jina-embeddings/\#jina-clip-v2) Jina CLIP v2

The code below demonstrates how to use `jina-clip-v2` with Qdrant:

```python

# Provide your Jina API key and choose the model.
JINA_API_KEY = "jina_xxxxxxxxxxx"

response_data = response.json()["data"]

# The model doesn't differentiate between images and text, so we extract output based on the input order.
text_embedding = response_data[0]["embedding"]
image_embedding = response_data[1]["embedding"]

# Initialize Qdrant client
client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333/")

# Create a collection with named vectors
collection_name = "MyCollection"
client.recreate_collection(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    vectors_config={
        "text_vector": VectorParams(size=DIMENSIONS, distance=Distance.DOT),
        "image_vector": VectorParams(size=DIMENSIONS, distance=Distance.DOT),

                "image_vector": image_embedding,\
            }\
        )\
    ],

# Now let's query the collection

# Get the embedding for the search query from the Jina API

    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {JINA_API_KEY}",
