## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/metadata-deasy-labs/\#top-takeaways)**Top takeaways:**

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and vector search are incomplete without high-quality metadata. In this episode of **Vector Space Talks**, Reece Griffiths explains how **metadata automation and optimization** can significantly enhance retrieval accuracy, filtering, and indexing efficiency.

Here are some key insights from this episode:

1. **Why Metadata Matters in Vector Search:** Traditional approaches often focus on embedding models, but metadata can bridge the gap between mediocre and high-performance search systems.
2. **Metadata for Segmentation vs. Enrichment:** Segmentation metadata helps filter and categorize data, while enrichment metadata provides additional context that improves retrieval accuracy.
3. **Optimizing Hybrid Search with Metadata:** Reece explains how metadata can be embedded into sparse vectors for **hybrid search**, enhancing keyword and semantic search combinations.
4. **Scaling Metadata Extraction:** Learn how Deasy Labs uses LLM-powered extraction methods to generate metadata dynamically and update taxonomies in real-time.
5. **Metadata as an Access Control Layer:** Metadata can also be leveraged for **role-based access control (RBAC)** by defining data slices that different teams or users can access within a knowledge base.

> Fun Fact: Reece and his team at Deasy Labs experimented with **pure metadata embeddings** (without the original data) and found that hybrid search using metadata alone can yield strong retrieval performance.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/metadata-deasy-labs/\#more-quotes-from-reece)**More Quotes from Reece:**

_‚ÄúGoing from 75% retrieval accuracy to 95%+ is hard. In many cases, 80% accuracy might as well be zero. Metadata is the key to getting that last mile.‚Äù_

‚Äî Reece Griffiths

_‚ÄúMetadata shouldn‚Äôt rely on manual tagging by business teams. With LLMs, we can auto-suggest domain-specific metadata dynamically and refine it over time.‚Äù_

‚Äî Reece Griffiths

_‚ÄúIn a vector database, segmentation metadata helps you structure your knowledge base, while enrichment metadata boosts retrieval precision‚Äîboth are critical.‚Äù_
