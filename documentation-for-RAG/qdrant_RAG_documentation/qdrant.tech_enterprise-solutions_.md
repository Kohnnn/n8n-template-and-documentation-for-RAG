## Enterprises Face Challenges in Scaling AI Applications

![Security & Compliance Risks](https://qdrant.tech/img/enterprise-solutions-challenges/icon1.svg)

##### Security & Compliance Risks

Enterprises need granular control over who accesses what data. Without robust **security frameworks, role-based access control (RBAC),** and **single sign-on (SSO)** integrations, managing compliance with regulations like **GDPR** becomes a complex challenge.

![Lack of Performance Visibility](https://qdrant.tech/img/enterprise-solutions-challenges/icon2.svg)

##### Lack of Performance Visibility

Scaling AI applications demands insights into system performance. Without **real-time monitoring and observability** into query latency, resource usage, and infrastructure health, teams face operational blind spots, slowing down optimization efforts and impacting performance.

![Credential Chaos & Access Management Bottlenecks](https://qdrant.tech/img/enterprise-solutions-challenges/icon3.svg)

##### Credential Chaos & Access Management Bottlenecks

Growing teams often juggle multiple authentication systems and struggle with **credential sprawl**. Without a unified access management solution, onboarding and enforcing policies become time-consuming, leading to **unauthorized access risks** and inefficient workflows.

![Manual Infrastructure Management Overhead](https://qdrant.tech/img/enterprise-solutions-challenges/icon4.svg)

##### Manual Infrastructure Management Overhead

Enterprises often struggle to keep up with scaling demands. **Manual cluster provisioning and management** lead to slow deployments, human errors, and high operational costs.

Enterprises like Bosch use Qdrant for unparalleled performance and massive-scale vector search. “With Qdrant, we found the missing piece to develop our own provider independent multimodal generative AI platform at enterprise scale.”
