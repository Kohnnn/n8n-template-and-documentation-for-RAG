# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#the-evolving-landscape-of-ai-frameworks) The Evolving Landscape of AI Frameworks

As Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector stores have become steadily more powerful, a new generation of frameworks has appeared which can streamline the development of AI applications by leveraging LLMs and vector search technology. These frameworks simplify the process of building everything from Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications to complex chatbots with advanced conversational abilities, and even sophisticated reasoning-driven AI applications.

The most well-known of these frameworks is possibly [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain). [Launched in October 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LangChain) as an open-source project by Harrison Chase, the project quickly gained popularity, attracting contributions from hundreds of developers on GitHub. LangChain excels in its broad support for documents, data sources, and APIs. This, along with seamless integration with vector stores like Qdrant and the ability to chain multiple LLMs, has allowed developers to build complex AI applications without reinventing the wheel.

However, despite the many capabilities unlocked by frameworks like LangChain, developers still needed expertise in [prompt engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) to craft optimal LLM prompts. Additionally, optimizing these prompts and adapting them to build multi-stage reasoning AI remained challenging with the existing frameworks.

In fact, as you start building production-grade AI applications, it becomes clear that a single LLM call isn’t enough to unlock the full capabilities of LLMs. Instead, you need to create a workflow where the model interacts with external tools like web browsers, fetches relevant snippets from documents, and compiles the results into a multi-stage reasoning pipeline.

This involves building an architecture that combines and reasons on intermediate outputs, with LLM prompts that adapt according to the task at hand, before producing a final output. A manual approach to prompt engineering quickly falls short in such scenarios.

In October 2023, researchers working in Stanford NLP released a library, [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy), which entirely automates the process of optimizing prompts and weights for large language models (LLMs), eliminating the need for manual prompting or prompt engineering.

One of DSPy’s key features is its ability to automatically tune LLM prompts, an approach that is especially powerful when your application needs to call the LLM several times within a pipeline.

So, when building an LLM and vector store-backed AI application, which of these frameworks should you choose? In this article, we dive deep into the capabilities of each and discuss scenarios where each of these frameworks shine. Let’s get started!

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#langchain-features-performance-and-use-cases)**LangChain: Features, Performance, and Use Cases**

LangChain, as discussed above, is an open-source orchestration framework available in both [Python](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) and [JavaScript](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/), designed to simplify the development of AI applications leveraging LLMs. For developers working with one or multiple LLMs, it acts as a universal interface for these AI models. LangChain integrates with various external data sources, supports a wide range of data types and stores, streamlines the handling of vector embeddings and retrieval through similarity search, and simplifies the integration of AI applications with existing software workflows.

At a high level, LangChain abstracts the common steps required to work with language models into modular components, which serve as the building blocks of AI applications. These components can be “chained” together to create complex applications. Thanks to these abstractions, LangChain allows for rapid experimentation and prototyping of AI applications in a short timeframe.

LangChain breaks down the functionality required to build AI applications into three key sections:

- **Model I/O**: Building blocks to interface with the LLM.
- **Retrieval**: Building blocks to streamline the retrieval of data used by the LLM for generation (such as the retrieval step in RAG applications).
- **Composition**: Components to combine external APIs, services and other LangChain primitives.

These components are pulled together into ‘chains’ that are constructed using [LangChain Expression Language](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/) (LCEL). We’ill first look at the various building blocks, and then see how they can be combined using LCEL.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#llm-model-io)**LLM Model I/O**

LangChain offers broad compatibility with various LLMs, and its [LLM](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/llms/) class provides a standard interface to these models. Leveraging proprietary models offered by platforms like OpenAI, Mistral, Cohere, or Gemini is straightforward and requires just an API key from the respective platform.

For instance, to use OpenAI models, you simply need to do the following:

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(api_key="...")

llm.invoke("Where is Paris?")

```

Open-source models like Meta AI’s Llama variants (such as Llama3-8B) or Mistral AI’s open models (like Mistral-7B) can be easily integrated using their Hugging Face endpoints or local LLM deployment tools like Ollama, vLLM, or LM Studio. You can also use the [CustomLLM](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/llms/custom_llm/) class to build Custom LLM wrappers.

Here’s how simple it is to use LangChain with LlaMa3-8B, using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Ollama

llm = Ollama(model="llama3")

llm.invoke("Where is Berlin?")

```

LangChain also offers output parsers to structure the LLM output in a format that the application may need, such as structured data types like JSON, XML, CSV, and others. To understand LangChain’s interface with LLMs in detail, read the documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/).

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#retrieval)**Retrieval**

Most enterprise AI applications are built by augmenting the LLM context using data specific to the application’s use case. To accomplish this, the relevant data needs to be first retrieved, typically using vector similarity search, and then passed to the LLM context at the generation step. This architecture, known as [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://qdrant.tech/articles/what-is-rag-in-ai/) (RAG), can be used to build a wide range of AI applications.

While the retrieval process sounds simple, it involves a number of complex steps: loading data from a source, splitting it into chunks, converting it into vectors or vector embeddings, storing it in a vector store, and then retrieving results based on a query before the generation step.

LangChain offers a number of building blocks to make this retrieval process simpler.

- **Document Loaders**: LangChain offers over 100 different document loaders, including integrations with providers like Unstructured or Airbyte. It also supports loading various types of documents, such as PDFs, HTML, CSV, and code, from a range of locations like S3.
- **Splitting**: During the retrieval step, you typically need to retrieve only the relevant section of a document. To do this, you need to split a large document into smaller chunks. LangChain offers various document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, filter, or manipulate documents.
- **Text Embeddings**: A key aspect of the retrieval step is converting document chunks into vectors, which are high-dimensional numerical representations that capture the semantic meaning of the text. LangChain offers integrations with over 25 embedding providers and methods, such as [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed).
- **Vector Store Integration**: LangChain integrates with over 50 vector stores, including specialized ones like [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/langchain/), and exposes a standard interface.
- **Retrievers**: LangChain offers various retrieval algorithms and allows you to use third-party retrieval algorithms or create custom retrievers.
- **Indexing**: LangChain also offers an indexing API that keeps data from any data source in sync with the vector store, helping to reduce complexities around managing unchanged content or avoiding duplicate content.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#composition)**Composition**

Finally, LangChain also offers building blocks that help combine external APIs, services, and LangChain primitives. For instance, it provides tools to fetch data from Wikipedia or search using Google Lens. The list of tools it offers is [extremely varied](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/tools/).

LangChain also offers ways to build agents that use language models to decide on the sequence of actions to take.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#lcel)**LCEL**

The primary method of building an application in LangChain is through the use of [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/), the LangChain Expression Language. It is a declarative syntax designed to simplify the composition of chains within the LangChain framework. It provides a minimalist code layer that enables the rapid development of chains, leveraging advanced features such as streaming, asynchronous execution, and parallel processing.

LCEL is particularly useful for building chains that involve multiple language model calls, data transformations, and the integration of outputs from language models into downstream applications.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#some-use-cases-of-langchain)**Some Use Cases of LangChain**

Given the flexibility that LangChain offers, a wide range of applications can be built using the framework. Here are some examples:

**RAG Applications**: LangChain provides all the essential building blocks needed to build Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It integrates with vector stores and LLMs, streamlining the entire process of loading, chunking, and retrieving relevant sections of a document in a few lines of code.

**Chatbots**: LangChain offers a suite of components that streamline the process of building conversational chatbots. These include chat models, which are specifically designed for message-based interactions and provide a conversational tone suitable for chatbots.

**Extracting Structured Outputs**: LangChain assists in extracting structured output from data using various tools and methods. It supports multiple extraction approaches, including tool/function calling mode, JSON mode, and prompting-based extraction.

**Agents**: LangChain simplifies the process of building agents by providing building blocks and integration with LLMs, enabling developers to construct complex, multi-step workflows. These agents can interact with external data sources and tools, and generate dynamic and context-aware responses for various applications.

If LangChain offers such a wide range of integrations and the primary building blocks needed to build AI applications, _why do we need another framework?_

As Omar Khattab, PhD, Stanford and researcher at Stanford NLP, said when introducing DSPy in his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt3H2ninoeY) at ‘Scale By the Bay’ in November 2023: “We can build good reliable systems with these new artifacts that are language models (LMs), but importantly, this is conditioned on us _adapting_ them as well as _stacking_ them well”.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#dspy-features-performance-and-use-cases)**DSPy: Features, Performance, and Use Cases**

When building AI systems, developers need to break down the task into multiple reasoning steps, adapt language model (LM) prompts for each step until they get the right results, and then ensure that the steps work together to achieve the desired outcome.

Complex multihop pipelines, where multiple LLM calls are stacked, are messy. They involve string-based prompting tricks or prompt hacks at each step, and getting the pipeline to work is even trickier.

Additionally, the manual prompting approach is highly unscalable, as any change in the underlying language model breaks the prompts and the pipeline. LMs are highly sensitive to prompts and slight changes in wording, context, or phrasing can significantly impact the model’s output. Due to this, despite the functionality provided by frameworks like LangChain, developers often have to spend a lot of time engineering prompts to get the right results from LLMs.

How do you build a system that’s less brittle and more predictable? Enter DSPy!

[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is built on the paradigm that language models (LMs) should be programmed rather than prompted. The framework is designed for algorithmically optimizing and adapting LM prompts and weights, and focuses on replacing prompting techniques with a programming-centric approach.

DSPy treats the LM like a device and abstracts out the underlying complexities of prompting. To achieve this, DSPy introduces three simple building blocks:

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#signatures)**Signatures**

[Signatures](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/signatures/) replace handwritten prompts and are written in natural language. They are simply declarations or specs of the behavior that you expect from the language model. Some examples are:

- question -> answer
- long\_document -> summary
- context, question -> rationale, response

Rather than manually crafting complex prompts or engaging in extensive fine-tuning of LLMs, signatures allow for the automatic generation of optimized prompts.

DSPy Signatures can be specified in two ways:

1. Inline Signatures: Simple tasks can be defined in a concise format, like “question -> answer” for question-answering or “document -> summary” for summarization.

2. Class-Based Signatures: More complex tasks might require class-based signatures, which can include additional instructions or descriptions about the inputs and outputs. For example, a class for emotion classification might clearly specify the range of emotions that can be classified.


### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#modules)**Modules**

Modules take signatures as input, and automatically generate high-quality prompts. Inspired heavily from PyTorch, DSPy [modules](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/) eliminate the need for crafting prompts manually.

The framework supports advanced modules like [dspy.ChainOfThought](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/ChainOfThought), which adds step-by-step rationalization before producing an output. The output not only provides answers but also rationales. Other modules include [dspy.ProgramOfThought](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/ProgramOfThought), which outputs code whose execution results dictate the response, and [dspy.ReAct](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/ReAct), an agent that uses tools to implement signatures.

DSPy also offers modules like [dspy.MultiChainComparison](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/modules/MultiChainComparison), which can compare multiple outputs from dspy.ChainOfThought in order to produce a final prediction. There are also utility modules like [dspy.majority](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/?h=modul#what-other-dspy-modules-are-there-how-can-i-use-them) for aggregating responses through voting.

Modules can be composed into larger programs, and you can compose multiple modules into bigger modules. This allows you to create complex, behavior-rich applications using language models.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#optimizers)**Optimizers**

[Optimizers](https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/optimizers/) take a set of modules that have been connected to create a pipeline, compile them into auto-optimized prompts, and maximize an outcome metric.

Essentially, optimizers are designed to generate, test, and refine prompts, and ensure that the final prompt is highly optimized for the specific dataset and task at hand. Using optimizers in the DSPy framework significantly simplifies the process of developing and refining LM applications by automating the prompt engineering process.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#building-ai-applications-with-dspy)**Building AI Applications with DSPy**

A typical DSPy program requires the developer to follow the following 8 steps:

1. **Defining the Task**: Identify the specific problem you want to solve, including the input and output formats.
2. **Defining the Pipeline**: Plan the sequence of operations needed to solve the task. Then craft the signatures and the modules.
3. **Testing with Examples**: Run the pipeline with a few examples to understand the initial performance. This helps in identifying immediate issues with the program and areas for improvement.
4. **Defining Your Data**: Prepare and structure your training and validation datasets. This is needed by the optimizer for training the model and evaluating its performance accurately.
5. **Defining Your Metric**: Choose metrics that will measure the success of your model. These metrics help the optimizer evaluate how well the model is performing.
6. **Collecting Zero-Shot Evaluations**: Run initial evaluations without prior training to establish a baseline. This helps in understanding the model’s capabilities and limitations out of the box.
7. **Compiling with a DSPy Optimizer**: Given the data and metric, you can now optimize the program. DSPy offers a variety of optimizers designed for different purposes. These optimizers can generate step-by-step examples, craft detailed instructions, and/or update language model prompts and weights as needed.
8. **Iterating**: Continuously refine each aspect of your task, from the pipeline and data to the metrics and evaluations. Iteration helps in gradually improving the model’s performance and adapting to new requirements.

![Process](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/process.jpg)

Process

**Language Model Setup**

Setting up the LM in DSPy is easy.

```python
# pip install dspy

import dspy

llm = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-1106', max_tokens=300)

dspy.configure(lm=llm)

# Let's test this. First define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).

qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')

# Then, run with the default LM configured.

response = qa(question="Where is Paris?")

print(response.answer)

```

You are not restricted to using one LLM in your program; you can use [multiple](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/language_models/?h=language#using-multiple-lms). DSPy can be used with both managed models such as OpenAI, Cohere, Anyscale, Together, or PremAI as well as with local LLM deployments through vLLM, Ollama, or TGI server. All LLM calls are cached by default.

**Vector Store Integration (Retrieval Model)**

You can easily set up [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/dspy/) vector store to act as the retrieval model. To do so, follow these steps:

```python
# pip install dspy-ai dspy-qdrant

import dspy

from dspy_qdrant import QdrantRM

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

llm = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

qdrant_client = QdrantClient()

qdrant_rm = QdrantRM("collection-name", qdrant_client, k=3)

dspy.settings.configure(lm=llm, rm=qdrant_rm)

```

The above code sets up DSPy to use Qdrant (localhost), with collection-name as the default retrieval client. You can now build a RAG module in the following way:

```python

class RAG(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_passages=5):
        super().__init__()

        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> answer') # using inline signature

    def forward(self, question):
        context = self.retrieve(question).passages
        prediction = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        return dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=prediction.answer)

```

Now you can use the RAG module like any Python module.

**Optimizing the Pipeline**

In this step, DSPy requires you to create a training dataset and a metric function, which can help validate the output of your program. Using this, DSPy tunes the parameters (i.e., the prompts and/or the LM weights) to maximize the accuracy of the RAG pipeline.

Using DSPy optimizers involves the following steps:

1. Set up your DSPy program with the desired signatures and modules.
2. Create a training and validation dataset, with example input and output that you expect from your DSPy program.
3. Choose an appropriate optimizer such as BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, MIPRO, or BootstrapFinetune.
4. Create a metric function that evaluates the performance of the DSPy program. You can evaluate based on accuracy or quality of responses, or on a metric that’s relevant to your program.
5. Run the optimizer with the DSPy program, metric function, and training inputs. DSPy will compile the program and automatically adjust parameters and improve performance.
6. Use the compiled program to perform the task. Iterate and adapt if required.

To learn more about optimizing DSPy programs, read [this](https://dspy.ai/learn/optimization/optimizers/).

DSPy is heavily influenced by PyTorch, and replaces complex prompting with reusable modules for common tasks. Instead of crafting specific prompts, you write code that DSPy automatically translates for the LLM. This, along with built-in optimizers, makes working with LLMs more systematic and efficient.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/dspy-vs-langchain/\#use-cases-of-dspy)**Use Cases of DSPy**

As we saw above, DSPy can be used to create fairly complex applications which require stacking multiple LM calls without the need for prompt engineering. Even though the framework is comparatively new - it started gaining popularity since November 2023 when it was first introduced - it has created a promising new direction for LLM-based applications.

Here are some of the possible uses of DSPy:

**Automating Prompt Engineering**: DSPy automates the process of creating prompts for LLMs, and allows developers to focus on the core logic of their application. This is powerful as manual prompt engineering makes AI applications highly unscalable and brittle.

**Building Chatbots**: The modular design of DSPy makes it well-suited for creating chatbots with improved response quality and faster development cycles. DSPy’s automatic prompting and optimizers can help ensure chatbots generate consistent and informative responses across different conversation contexts.

**Complex Information Retrieval Systems**: DSPy programs can be easily integrated with vector stores, and used to build multi-step information retrieval systems with stacked calls to the LLM. This can be used to build highly sophisticated retrieval systems. For example, DSPy can be used to develop custom search engines that understand complex user queries and retrieve the most relevant information from vector stores.

**Improving LLM Pipelines**: One of the best uses of DSPy is to optimize LLM pipelines. DSPy’s modular design greatly simplifies the integration of LLMs into existing workflows. Additionally, DSPy’s built-in optimizers can help fine-tune LLM pipelines based on desired metrics.

**Multi-Hop Question-Answering**: Multi-hop question-answering involves answering complex questions that require reasoning over multiple pieces of information, which are often scattered across different documents or sections of text. With DSPy, users can leverage its automated prompt engineering capabilities to develop prompts that effectively guide the model on how to piece together information from various sources.
