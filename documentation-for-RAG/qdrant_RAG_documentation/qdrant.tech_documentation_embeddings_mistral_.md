# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#mistral) Mistral

Qdrant is compatible with the new released Mistral Embed and its official Python SDK that can be installed as any other package:

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#setup) Setup

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#install-the-client) Install the client

```bash
pip install mistralai

```

And then we set this up:

```python
from mistralai.client import MistralClient
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.models import PointStruct, VectorParams, Distance

collection_name = "example_collection"

MISTRAL_API_KEY = "your_mistral_api_key"
client = QdrantClient(":memory:")
mistral_client = MistralClient(api_key=MISTRAL_API_KEY)
texts = [\
    "Qdrant is the best vector search engine!",\
    "Loved by Enterprises and everyone building for low latency, high performance, and scale.",\
]

```

Let‚Äôs see how to use the Embedding Model API to embed a document for retrieval.

The following example shows how to embed a document with the `models/embedding-001` with the `retrieval_document` task type:

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#embedding-a-document) Embedding a document

```python
result = mistral_client.embeddings(
    model="mistral-embed",
    input=texts,
)

```

The returned result has a data field with a key: `embedding`. The value of this key is a list of floats representing the embedding of the document.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#converting-this-into-qdrant-points) Converting this into Qdrant Points

```python
points = [\
    PointStruct(\
        id=idx,\
        vector=response.embedding,\
        payload={"text": text},\
    )\
    for idx, (response, text) in enumerate(zip(result.data, texts))\
]

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#create-a-collection-and-insert-the-documents) Create a collection and Insert the documents

```python
client.create_collection(collection_name, vectors_config=VectorParams(
        size=1024,
        distance=Distance.COSINE,
    )
)
client.upsert(collection_name, points)

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#searching-for-documents-with-qdrant) Searching for documents with Qdrant

Once the documents are indexed, you can search for the most relevant documents using the same model with the `retrieval_query` task type:

```python
client.search(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    query_vector=mistral_client.embeddings(
        model="mistral-embed", input=["What is the best to use for vector search scaling?"]
    ).data[0].embedding,
)

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mistral/\#using-mistral-embedding-models-with-binary-quantization) Using Mistral Embedding Models with Binary Quantization

You can use Mistral Embedding Models with [Binary Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/binary-quantization/) \- a technique that allows you to reduce the size of the embeddings by 32 times without losing the quality of the search results too much.

At an oversampling of 3 and a limit of 100, we‚Äôve a 95% recall against the exact nearest neighbors with rescore enabled.

| Oversampling |  | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | **Rescore** | False | True | False | True | False | True |
| **Limit** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 10 |  | 0.53444 | 0.857778 | 0.534444 | 0.918889 | 0.533333 | 0.941111 |
| 20 |  | 0.508333 | 0.837778 | 0.508333 | 0.903889 | 0.508333 | 0.927778 |
| 50 |  | 0.492222 | 0.834444 | 0.492222 | 0.903556 | 0.492889 | 0.940889 |
| 100 |  | 0.499111 | 0.845444 | 0.498556 | 0.918333 | 0.497667 | **0.944556** |

That‚Äôs it! You can now use Mistral Embedding Models with Qdrant!
