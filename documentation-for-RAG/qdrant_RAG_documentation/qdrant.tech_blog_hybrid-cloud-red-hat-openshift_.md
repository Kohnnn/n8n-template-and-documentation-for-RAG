We’re excited about our collaboration with Red Hat to bring the Qdrant vector database to [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) customers! With the release of [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/), developers can now deploy and run the Qdrant vector database directly in their Red Hat OpenShift environment. This collaboration enables developers to scale more seamlessly, operate more consistently across hybrid cloud environments, and maintain complete control over their vector data. This is a big step forward in simplifying AI infrastructure and empowering data-driven projects, like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) use cases, advanced search scenarios, or recommendations systems.

In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the demand for being able to manage the modern AI stack within the existing infrastructure becomes increasingly relevant for businesses. As enterprises are launching new AI applications and use cases into production, they require the ability to maintain complete control over their data, since these new apps often work with sensitive internal and customer-centric data that needs to remain within the owned premises. This is why enterprises are increasingly looking for maximum deployment flexibility for their AI workloads.

> _“Red Hat is committed to driving transparency, flexibility and choice for organizations to more easily unlock the power of AI. By working with partners like Qdrant to enable streamlined integration experiences on Red Hat OpenShift for AI use cases, organizations can more effectively harness critical data and deliver real business outcomes,”_ said Steven Huels, Vice President and General Manager, AI Business Unit, Red Hat.

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is the first vector database that can be deployed anywhere, with complete database isolation, while still providing a fully managed cluster management. Running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Red Hat OpenShift allows enterprises to deploy and run a fully managed vector database in their own environment, ultimately allowing businesses to run managed vector search on their existing cloud and infrastructure environments, with full data sovereignty.

Red Hat OpenShift, the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes, helps streamline the deployment of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud within an enterprise’s secure premises. Red Hat OpenShift provides features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and advanced security controls that can help you manage and maintain your vector database deployments more effectively. In addition, Red Hat OpenShift supports deployment across multiple environments, including on-premises, public, private and hybrid cloud landscapes. This flexibility, coupled with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, allows organizations to choose the deployment model that best suits their needs.
