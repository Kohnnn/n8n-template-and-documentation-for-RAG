Developers are constantly seeking new ways to enhance their AI applications with new customer experiences. At the core of this are vector databases, as they enable the efficient handling of complex, unstructured data, making it possible to power applications with semantic search, personalized recommendation systems, and intelligent Q&A platforms. However, when deploying such new AI applications, especially those handling sensitive or personal user data, privacy becomes important.

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and Qdrant are actively addressing this with an integration that lets developers deploy a managed vector database in their existing DigitalOcean environments. With the recent launch of [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/), developers can seamlessly deploy Qdrant on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters, making it easier for developers to handle vector databases without getting bogged down in the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.

User data is a critical asset for a business, and user privacy should always be a top priority. This is why businesses require tools that enable them to leverage their user data as a valuable asset while respecting privacy. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on DigitalOcean brings these capabilities directly into developers’ hands, enhancing deployment flexibility and ensuring greater control over data.

> _“Qdrant, with its seamless integration and robust performance, equips businesses to develop cutting-edge applications that truly resonate with their users. Through applications such as semantic search, Q&A systems, recommendation engines, image search, and RAG, DigitalOcean customers can leverage their data to the fullest, ensuring privacy and driving innovation.“_ \- Bikram Gupta, Lead Product Manager, Kubernetes & App Platform, DigitalOcean.
