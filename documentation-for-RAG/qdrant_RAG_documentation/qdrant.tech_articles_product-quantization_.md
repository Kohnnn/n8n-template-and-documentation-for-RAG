Qdrant 1.1.0 brought the support of [Scalar Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/),
a technique of reducing the memory footprint by even four times, by using `int8` to represent
the values that would be normally represented by `float32`.

The memory usage in [vector search](https://qdrant.tech/solutions/) might be reduced even further! Please welcome **Product**
**Quantization**, a brand-new feature of Qdrant 1.2.0!

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#what-is-product-quantization) What is Product Quantization?

Product Quantization converts floating-point numbers into integers like every other quantization
method. However, the process is slightly more complicated than [Scalar Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/) and is more customizable, so you can find the sweet spot between memory usage and search precision. This article
covers all the steps required to perform Product Quantization and the way it‚Äôs implemented in Qdrant.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#how-does-product-quantization-work) How Does Product Quantization Work?

Let‚Äôs assume we have a few vectors being added to the collection and that our optimizer decided
to start creating a new segment.

![A list of raw vectors](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/raw-vectors.png)

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#cutting-the-vector-into-pieces) Cutting the vector into pieces

First of all, our vectors are going to be divided into **chunks** aka **subvectors**. The number
of chunks is configurable, but as a rule of thumb - the lower it is, the higher the compression rate.
That also comes with reduced search precision, but in some cases, you may prefer to keep the memory
usage as low as possible.

![A list of chunked vectors](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/chunked-vectors.png)

Qdrant API allows choosing the compression ratio from 4x up to 64x. In our example, we selected 16x,
so each subvector will consist of 4 floats (16 bytes), and it will eventually be represented by
a single byte.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#clustering) Clustering

The chunks of our vectors are then used as input for clustering. Qdrant uses the K-means algorithm,
with K=256. It was selected a priori, as this is the maximum number of values a single byte
represents. As a result, we receive a list of 256 centroids for each chunk and assign each of them
a unique id. **The clustering is done separately for each group of chunks.**

![Clustered chunks of vectors](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/chunks-clustering.png)

Each chunk of a vector might now be mapped to the closest centroid. That‚Äôs where we lose the precision,
as a single point will only represent a whole subspace. Instead of using a subvector, we can store
the id of the closest centroid. If we repeat that for each chunk, we can approximate the original
embedding as a vector of subsequent ids of the centroids. The dimensionality of the created vector
is equal to the number of chunks, in our case 2.

![A new vector built from the ids of the centroids](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/vector-of-ids.png)

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#full-process) Full process

All those steps build the following pipeline of Product Quantization:

![Full process of Product Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/full-process.png)

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#measuring-the-distance) Measuring the distance

Vector search relies on the distances between the points. Enabling Product Quantization slightly changes
the way it has to be calculated. The query vector is divided into chunks, and then we figure the overall
distance as a sum of distances between the subvectors and the centroids assigned to the specific id of
the vector we compare to. We know the coordinates of the centroids, so that‚Äôs easy.

![Calculating the distance of between the query and the stored vector](https://qdrant.tech/articles_data/product-quantization/distance-calculation.png)

#### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#qdrant-implementation) Qdrant implementation

Search operation requires calculating the distance to multiple points. Since we calculate the
distance to a finite set of centroids, those might be precomputed and reused. Qdrant creates
a lookup table for each query, so it can then simply sum up several terms to measure the
distance between a query and all the centroids.

|  | Centroid 0 | Centroid 1 | ‚Ä¶ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Chunk 0** | 0.14213 | 0.51242 |  |
| **Chunk 1** | 0.08421 | 0.00142 |  |
| **‚Ä¶** | ‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ | ‚Ä¶ |

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#product-quantization-benchmarks) Product Quantization Benchmarks

Product Quantization comes with a cost - there are some additional operations to perform so
that the performance might be reduced. However, memory usage might be reduced drastically as
well. As usual, we did some benchmarks to give you a brief understanding of what you may expect.

Again, we reused the same pipeline as in [the other benchmarks we published](https://qdrant.tech/benchmarks/). We
selected [Arxiv-titles-384-angular-no-filters](https://github.com/qdrant/ann-filtering-benchmark-datasets)
and [Glove-100](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/) datasets to measure the impact
of Product Quantization on precision and time. Both experiments were launched with EF=128.
The results are summarized in the tables:

#### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#glove-100) Glove-100

|  | Original | 1D clusters | 2D clusters | 3D clusters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mean precision | 0.7158 | 0.7143 | 0.6731 | 0.5854 |
| Mean search time | 2336 ¬µs | 2750 ¬µs | 2597 ¬µs | 2534 ¬µs |
| Compression | x1 | x4 | x8 | x12 |
| Upload & indexing time | 147 s | 339 s | 217 s | 178 s |

Product Quantization increases both indexing and searching time. The higher the compression ratio,
the lower the search precision. The main benefit is undoubtedly the reduced usage of memory.

#### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#arxiv-titles-384-angular-no-filters) Arxiv-titles-384-angular-no-filters

|  | Original | 1D clusters | 2D clusters | 4D clusters | 8D clusters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mean precision | 0.9837 | 0.9677 | 0.9143 | 0.8068 | 0.6618 |
| Mean search time | 2719 ¬µs | 4134 ¬µs | 2947 ¬µs | 2175 ¬µs | 2053 ¬µs |
| Compression | x1 | x4 | x8 | x16 | x32 |
| Upload & indexing time | 332 s | 921 s | 597 s | 481 s | 474 s |

It turns out that in some cases, Product Quantization may not only reduce the memory usage,
but also the search time.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/articles/product-quantization/\#product-quantization-vs-scalar-quantization) Product Quantization vs Scalar Quantization

Compared to [Scalar Quantization](https://qdrant.tech/articles/scalar-quantization/), Product Quantization offers a higher compression rate. However, this comes with considerable trade-offs in accuracy, and at times, in-RAM search speed.

Product Quantization tends to be favored in certain specific scenarios:

- Deployment in a low-RAM environment where the limiting factor is the number of disk reads rather than the vector comparison itself
- Situations where the dimensionality of the original vectors is sufficiently high
- Cases where indexing speed is not a critical factor

In circumstances that do not align with the above, Scalar Quantization should be the preferred choice.
