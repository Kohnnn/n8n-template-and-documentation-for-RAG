### AI Agents with Qdrant

AI agents powered by Qdrant leverage advanced vector search to access and retrieve high-dimensional data in real-time, enabling intelligent, Agentic-RAG driven, multi-step decision-making across dynamic environments.

###### Multimodal Data Handling

Qdrant enables AI agents to process and retrieve high-dimensional vectors from diverse data types (text, images, audio), supporting more comprehensive decision-making in multimodal environments.

###### Adaptive Learning

Qdrant supports continuous learning by enabling efficient vector retrieval and updates, allowing agents to learn and evolve based on real-time interactions and new data points.

### Qdrant equips AI agents to adapt, learn, and collaborate efficiently.

[![Precision](https://qdrant.tech/icons/outline/precision-blue.svg)**Contextual Precision** \\
Qdrant’s hybrid search combines semantic vector search, lexical search, and metadata filtering, enabling AI Agents to retrieve highly relevant and contextually precise information. This enhances decision-making by allowing agents to leverage both meaning-based and keyword-based strategies, ensuring accuracy and relevance for complex queries in dynamic environments.\\
