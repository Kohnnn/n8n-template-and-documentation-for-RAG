# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#using-fastembed-with-qdrant-for-vector-search) Using FastEmbed with Qdrant for Vector Search

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#install-qdrant-client-and-fastembed) Install Qdrant Client and FastEmbed

```python
pip install "qdrant-client[fastembed]>=1.14.2"

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#initialize-the-client) Initialize the client

Qdrant Client has a simple in-memory mode that lets you try semantic search locally.

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(":memory:")  # Qdrant is running from RAM.

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#add-data) Add data

Now you can add two sample documents, their associated metadata, and a point `id` for each.

```python
docs = [\
    "Qdrant has a LangChain integration for chatbots.",\
    "Qdrant has a LlamaIndex integration for agents.",\
]
metadata = [\
    {"source": "langchain-docs"},\
    {"source": "llamaindex-docs"},\
]
ids = [42, 2]

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#create-a-collection) Create a collection

Qdrant stores vectors and associated metadata in collections.
Collection requires vector parameters to be set during creation.
In this tutorial, we‚Äôll be using `BAAI/bge-small-en` to compute embeddings.

```python
model_name = "BAAI/bge-small-en"
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=client.get_embedding_size(model_name),
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE
    ),  # size and distance are model dependent
)

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#upsert-documents-to-the-collection) Upsert documents to the collection

Qdrant client can do inference implicitly within its methods via FastEmbed integration.
It requires wrapping your data in models, like `models.Document` (or `models.Image` if you‚Äôre working with images)

```python
metadata_with_docs = [\
    {"document": doc, "source": meta["source"]} for doc, meta in zip(docs, metadata)\
]
client.upload_collection(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    vectors=[models.Document(text=doc, model=model_name) for doc in docs],
    payload=metadata_with_docs,
    ids=ids,
)

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/fastembed-semantic-search/\#run-vector-search) Run vector search

Here, you will ask a dummy question that will allow you to retrieve a semantically relevant result.

```python
search_result = client.query_points(
    collection_name="test_collection",
    query=models.Document(
        text="Which integration is best for agents?",
        model=model_name
    )
).points
print(search_result)

```

The semantic search engine will retrieve the most similar result in order of relevance. In this case, the second statement about LlamaIndex is more relevant.

```python
[\
    ScoredPoint(\
        id=2,\
        score=0.87491801319731,\
        payload={\
            "document": "Qdrant has a LlamaIndex integration for agents.",\
            "source": "llamaindex-docs",\
        },\
        ...\
    ),\
    ScoredPoint(\
        id=42,\
        score=0.8351846627714035,\
        payload={\
            "document": "Qdrant has a LangChain integration for chatbots.",\
            "source": "langchain-docs",\
        },\
        ...\
    ),\
]

```
