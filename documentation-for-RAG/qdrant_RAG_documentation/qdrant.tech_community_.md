Indexing millions of embeddings into @qdrant\_engine has been the smoothest experience I've had so far with a vector db. Team Rustacian all the way ü¶Ä

I am so inspired by Qdrant's performance. It is simply off the charts. How they do such a complex operation in under 100ms is exceptional. I've never witnessed first hand a tool like it.
