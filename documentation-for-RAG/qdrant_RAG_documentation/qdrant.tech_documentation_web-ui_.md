# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/web-ui/\#qdrant-web-ui) Qdrant Web UI

You can manage both local and cloud Qdrant deployments through the Web UI.

If you‚Äôve set up a deployment locally with the Qdrant [Quickstart](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/),
navigate to http://localhost:6333/dashboard.

If you‚Äôve set up a deployment in a cloud cluster, find your Cluster URL in your
cloud dashboard, at [https://cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io/). Add `:6333/dashboard` to the end
of the URL.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/web-ui/\#access-the-web-ui) Access the Web UI

Qdrant‚Äôs Web UI is an intuitive and efficient graphic interface for your Qdrant Collections, REST API and data points.

In the **Console**, you may use the REST API to interact with Qdrant, while in **Collections**, you can manage all the collections and upload Snapshots.

### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/web-ui/\#qdrant-web-ui-features) Qdrant Web UI features

In the Qdrant Web UI, you can:

- Run HTTP-based calls from the console
- List and search existing [collections](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/)
- Learn from our interactive tutorial

You can navigate to these options directly. For example, if you used our
[quick start](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quick-start/) to set up a cluster on localhost,
you can review our tutorial at http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/tutorial.
