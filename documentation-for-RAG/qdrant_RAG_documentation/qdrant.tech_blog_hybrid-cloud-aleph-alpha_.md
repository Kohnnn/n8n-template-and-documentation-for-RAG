[Aleph Alpha](https://aleph-alpha.com/) and Qdrant are on a joint mission to empower the world’s best companies in their AI journey. The launch of [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/) furthers this effort by ensuring complete data sovereignty and hosting security. This latest collaboration is all about giving enterprise customers complete transparency and sovereignty to make use of AI in their own environment. By using a hybrid cloud vector database, those looking to leverage vector search for the AI applications can now ensure their proprietary and customer data is completely secure.

Aleph Alpha’s state-of-the-art technology, offering unmatched quality and safety, cater perfectly to large-scale business applications and complex scenarios utilized by professionals across fields such as science, law, and security globally. Recognizing that these sophisticated use cases often demand comprehensive data processing capabilities beyond what standalone LLMs can provide, the collaboration between Aleph Alpha and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud introduces a robust platform. This platform empowers customers with full data sovereignty, enabling secure management of highly specific and sensitive information within their own infrastructure.

Together with Aleph Alpha, Qdrant Hybrid Cloud offers an ecosystem where individual components seamlessly integrate with one another. Qdrant’s new Kubernetes-native design coupled with Aleph Alpha’s powerful technology meet the needs of developers who are both prototyping and building production-level apps.
