Our Mission

## Building the most efficient, scalable, high-performance vector database on the market

## Our story

#### A paradigm shift is underway in the field of data management and information retrieval.

Today, our world is increasingly dominated by complex, unstructured data like images, audio, video, and text. Traditional ways of retrieving data based on keyword matching are no longer sufficient. Vector databases are designed to handle complex high-dimensional data, unlocking the foundation for pivotal AI applications.

##### In 2021

We started Qdrant with the mission to build the most efficient, scalable, high-performance vector database on the market. Since then we have seen incredible user growth and support from our open-source community with thousands of users and millions of downloads.

###### Today Qdrant powers the most ambitious AI applications, from cutting-edge startups to large-scale enterprises.
