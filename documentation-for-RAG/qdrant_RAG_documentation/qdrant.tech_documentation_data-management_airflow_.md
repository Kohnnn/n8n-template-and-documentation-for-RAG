# [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#apache-airflow) Apache Airflow

[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) is an open-source platform for authoring, scheduling and monitoring data and computing workflows. Airflow uses Python to create workflows that can be easily scheduled and monitored.

Qdrant is available as a [provider](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-qdrant/stable/index.html) in Airflow to interface with the database.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#prerequisites) Prerequisites

Before configuring Airflow, you need:

1. A Qdrant instance to connect to. You can set one up in our [installation guide](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/installation/).

2. A running Airflow instance. You can use their [Quick Start Guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html).


## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#installation) Installation

You can install the Qdrant provider by running `pip install apache-airflow-providers-qdrant` in your Airflow shell.

**NOTE**: You‚Äôll have to restart your Airflow session for the provider to be available.

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#setting-up-a-connection) Setting up a connection

Open the `Admin-> Connections` section of the Airflow UI. Click the `Create` link to create a new [Qdrant connection](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-qdrant/stable/connections.html).

![Qdrant connection](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/frameworks/airflow/connection.png)

You can also set up a connection using [environment variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html#environment-variables-connections) or an [external secret backend](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/security/secrets/secrets-backend/index.html).

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#qdrant-hook) Qdrant hook

An Airflow hook is an abstraction of a specific API that allows Airflow to interact with an external system.

```python
from airflow.providers.qdrant.hooks.qdrant import QdrantHook

hook = QdrantHook(conn_id="qdrant_connection")

hook.verify_connection()

```

A [`qdrant_client#QdrantClient`](https://pypi.org/project/qdrant-client/) instance is available via `@property conn` of the `QdrantHook` instance for use within your Airflow workflows.

```python
from qdrant_client import models

hook.conn.count("<COLLECTION_NAME>")

hook.conn.upsert(
    "<COLLECTION_NAME>",
    points=[\
        models.PointStruct(id=32, vector=[0.32, 0.12, 0.123], payload={"color": "red"})\
    ],
)

```

## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/data-management/airflow/\#qdrant-ingest-operator) Qdrant Ingest Operator

The Qdrant provider also provides a convenience operator for uploading data to a Qdrant collection that internally uses the Qdrant hook.

```python
from airflow.providers.qdrant.operators.qdrant import QdrantIngestOperator

vectors = [\
    [0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44],\
    [0.55, 0.66, 0.77, 0.88],\
    [0.88, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13],\
]
ids = [32, 21, "b626f6a9-b14d-4af9-b7c3-43d8deb719a6"]
payload = [{"meta": "data"}, {"meta": "data_2"}, {"meta": "data_3", "extra": "data"}]

QdrantIngestOperator(
    conn_id="qdrant_connection",
    task_id="qdrant_ingest",
    collection_name="<COLLECTION_NAME>",
    vectors=vectors,
    ids=ids,
    payload=payload,
)

```
