As the AI application landscape evolves, the industry is transitioning from prototyping innovative AI solutions to actively deploying AI applications into production (incl. GenAI, semantic search, or recommendation systems). In this new phase, **privacy**, **data sovereignty**, **deployment flexibility**, and **control** are at the top of developers’ minds. These factors are critical when developing, launching, and scaling new applications, whether they are customer-facing services like AI assistants or internal company solutions for knowledge and information retrieval or process automation.

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud offers developers a vector database that can be deployed in any existing environment, ensuring data sovereignty and privacy control through complete database isolation - with the full capabilities of our managed cloud service.

![hybrid-cloud-environments](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud/hybrid-cloud-environments.png)

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, powered by our seamless Kubernetes-native architecture, is the first managed vector database engineered for unparalleled deployment flexibility. This means that regardless of where you run your AI applications, you can now enjoy the benefits of a fully managed Qdrant vector database, simplifying operations across any cloud, on-premise, or edge locations.

For this launch of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, we are proud to collaborate with key cloud providers, including [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/qdrant-hybrid-cloud-now-available-oci-customers), [Red Hat OpenShift](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-red-hat-openshift/), [Vultr](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-vultr/), [DigitalOcean](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-digitalocean/), [OVHcloud](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-ovhcloud/), [Scaleway](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-scaleway/), [Civo](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/hybrid-cloud/platform-deployment-options/#civo), and [STACKIT](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-stackit/). These partnerships underscore our commitment to delivering a versatile and robust vector database solution that meets the complex deployment requirements of today’s AI applications.

In addition to our partnerships with key cloud providers, we are also launching in collaboration with renowned AI development tools and framework leaders, including [LlamaIndex](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-llamaindex/), [LangChain](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-langchain/), [Airbyte](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-airbyte/), [JinaAI](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-jinaai/), [Haystack by deepset](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-haystack/), and [Aleph Alpha](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-aleph-alpha/).

Proprietary data, the lifeblood of AI-driven innovation, fuels personalized experiences, accurate recommendations, and timely anomaly detection. This data, unique to each organization, encompasses customer behaviors, internal processes, and market insights - crucial for tailoring AI applications to specific business needs and competitive differentiation. However, leveraging such data effectively while ensuring its **security, privacy, and control** requires diligence.

The innovative architecture of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud ensures **complete database isolation**, empowering developers with the autonomy to tailor where they process their vector search workloads with total data sovereignty. Rooted deeply in our commitment to open-source principles, this approach aims to foster a new level of trust and reliability by providing the essential tools to navigate the exciting landscape of enterprise AI.

#### [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud/\#how-we-designed-the-qdrant-hybrid-cloud-architecture) How We Designed the Qdrant Hybrid Cloud Architecture

We designed the architecture of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to meet the evolving needs of businesses seeking unparalleled flexibility, control, and privacy.

- **Kubernetes-Native Design**: By embracing Kubernetes, we’ve ensured that our architecture is both scalable and adaptable. This choice supports our deployment flexibility principle, allowing Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to integrate seamlessly with any infrastructure that can run Kubernetes.

- **Decoupled Data and Control Planes**: Our architecture separates the data plane (where the data is stored and processed) from the control plane (which manages the cluster operations). This separation enhances security, allows for more granular control over the data, and enables the data plane to reside anywhere the user chooses.

- **Unified Management Interface**: Despite the underlying complexity and the diversity of deployment environments, we designed a unified, user-friendly interface that simplifies the Qdrant cluster management. This interface supports everything from deployment to scaling and upgrading operations, all accessible from the [Qdrant Cloud portal](https://cloud.qdrant.io/login?ajs_anonymous_id=a60ca3da-0484-4476-b465-fef77b09394d).

- **Extensible and Modular**: Recognizing the rapidly evolving nature of technology and enterprise needs, we built Qdrant Hybrid Cloud to be both extensible and modular. Users can easily integrate new services, data sources, and deployment environments as their requirements grow and change.
