Shakudo’s VPC deployments ensure that client data remains within their infrastructure, providing strict control over sensitive information while leveraging a fully managed AI toolset. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is tailored for environments where data privacy and regulatory compliance are paramount. It keeps the data plane inside the customer’s infrastructure, with only essential telemetry shared externally, guaranteeing database isolation and security, while providing a fully managed service.
