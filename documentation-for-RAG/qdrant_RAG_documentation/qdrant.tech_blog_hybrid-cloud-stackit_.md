Qdrant and [STACKIT](https://www.stackit.de/en/) are thrilled to announce that developers are now able to deploy a fully managed vector database to their STACKIT environment with the introduction of [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/). This is a great step forward for the German AI ecosystem as it enables developers and businesses to build cutting edge AI applications that run on German data centers with full control over their data.

Vector databases are an essential component of the modern AI stack. They enable rapid and accurate retrieval of high-dimensional data, crucial for powering search, recommendation systems, and augmenting machine learning models. In the rising field of GenAI, vector databases power retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) scenarios as they are able to enhance the output of large language models (LLMs) by injecting relevant contextual information. However, this contextual information is often rooted in confidential internal or customer-related information, which is why enterprises are in pursuit of solutions that allow them to make this data available for their AI applications without compromising data privacy, losing data control, or letting data exit the company’s secure environment.

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is the first managed vector database that can be deployed in an existing STACKIT environment. The Kubernetes-native setup allows businesses to operate a fully managed vector database, while maintaining control over their data through complete data isolation. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud’s managed service seamlessly integrates into STACKIT’s cloud environment, allowing businesses to deploy fully managed vector search workloads, secure in the knowledge that their operations are backed by the stringent data protection standards of Germany’s data centers and in full compliance with GDPR. This setup not only ensures that data remains under the businesses control but also paves the way for secure, AI-driven application development.

![hybrid-cloud-stackit-tutorial](https://qdrant.tech/blog/hybrid-cloud-stackit/hybrid-cloud-stackit-tutorial.png)

To demonstrate the power of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on STACKIT, we’ve developed a comprehensive tutorial showcasing how to build secure, AI-driven applications focusing on data sovereignty. This tutorial specifically shows how to build a contract management platform that enables users to upload documents (PDF or DOCx), which are then segmented for searchable access. Designed with multitenancy, users can only access their team or organization’s documents. It also features custom sharding for location-specific document storage. Beyond search, the application offers rephrasing of document excerpts for clarity to those without context.
