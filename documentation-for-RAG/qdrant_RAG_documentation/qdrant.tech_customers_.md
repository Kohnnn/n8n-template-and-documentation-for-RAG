Go ahead and checkout Qdrant. I plan to build a movie retrieval search where you can ask anything regarding a movie based on the vector embeddings generated by a LLM. It can also be used for getting recommendations.

Using Qdrant as a blazing fact vector store for a stealth project of mine. It offers fantasic functionality for semantic search ✨

We have been using Qdrant in production now for over 6 months to store vectors for cosine similarity search and it is way more stable and faster than our old ElasticSearch vector index.

No merging segments, no red indexes at random times. It just works and was super easy to deploy via docker to our cluster.

It’s faster, cheaper to host, and more stable, and open source to boot!

Amidst the hype around vector databases, Qdrant is by far my favorite one. It's super fast (written in Rust) and open-source! At Kern AI we use Qdrant for fast document retrieval and to do quick similarity search for text data.
