In their mission to support large-scale AI innovation, [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) and Qdrant are collaborating on the launch of Qdrant’s new offering - [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/). This collaboration allows users to leverage the synergistic capabilities of both Airbyte and Qdrant within a private infrastructure. Qdrant’s new offering represents the first managed [vector database](https://qdrant.tech/articles/what-is-a-vector-database/) that can be deployed in any environment. Businesses optimizing their data infrastructure with Airbyte are now able to host a vector database either on premise, or on a public cloud of their choice - while still reaping the benefits of a managed database product.

This is a major step forward in offering enterprise customers incredible synergy for maximizing the potential of their AI data. Qdrant’s new Kubernetes-native design, coupled with Airbyte’s powerful data ingestion pipelines meet the needs of developers who are both prototyping and building production-level apps. Airbyte simplifies the process of data integration by providing a platform that connects to various sources and destinations effortlessly. Moreover, Qdrant Hybrid Cloud leverages advanced indexing and search capabilities to empower users to explore and analyze their data efficiently.

In a major benefit to Generative AI, businesses can leverage Airbyte’s data replication capabilities to ensure that their data in Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is always up to date. This empowers all users of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with effective analysis and decision-making potential, all based on the latest information. Furthermore, by combining Airbyte’s platform and Qdrant’s hybrid cloud infrastructure, users can optimize their data operations while keeping costs under control via flexible pricing models tailored to individual usage requirements.

> _“The new Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is an exciting addition that offers peace of mind and flexibility, aligning perfectly with the needs of Airbyte Enterprise users who value the same balance. Being open-source at our core, both Qdrant and Airbyte prioritize giving users the flexibility to build and test locally—a significant advantage for data engineers and AI practitioners. We’re enthusiastic about the Hybrid Cloud launch, as it mirrors our vision of enabling users to confidently transition from local development and local deployments to a managed solution, with both cloud and hybrid cloud deployment options.”_ AJ Steers, Staff Engineer for AI, Airbyte
