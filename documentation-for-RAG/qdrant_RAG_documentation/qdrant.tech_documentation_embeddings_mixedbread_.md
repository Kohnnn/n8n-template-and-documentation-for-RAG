## [Anchor](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/mixedbread/\#integration-example) Integration Example

Below is an example of how to obtain embeddings using MixedBread‚Äôs API and store them in a Qdrant collection:

```python
import qdrant_client
from qdrant_client.models import Batch
from mixedbread import MixedBreadModel

# Initialize MixedBread model
model = MixedBreadModel("mixedbread-variant")

# Generate embeddings
text = "MixedBread provides versatile embeddings for various domains."
embeddings = model.embed(text)

# Initialize Qdrant client
qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

# Upsert the embedding into Qdrant
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="VersatileEmbeddings",
    points=Batch(
        ids=[1],
        vectors=[embeddings],
    )
)

```
