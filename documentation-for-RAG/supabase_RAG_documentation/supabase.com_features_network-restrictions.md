Supabase's Network Restrictions feature allows you to control which IP addresses or ranges can access your database, enhancing your application's security and helping you meet compliance requirements.

## Key features

1. IP-based access control: Limit database connections to specific IPv4 and IPv6 ranges.
2. Flexible configuration: Easily manage restrictions via Dashboard or CLI.
3. Environment-specific rules: Set different access policies for development, staging, and production.
4. Pre-authentication barrier: Restrictions are enforced before database credential checks.

## Benefits:

- Enhanced security: Reduce the attack surface by limiting access to trusted IP addresses.
- Compliance support: Meet regulatory requirements for data access control in various industries.
- Granular control: Tailor access rules to your specific network infrastructure needs.
- Additional protection layer: Mitigate risks even if database credentials are compromised.

## Network Restrictions are particularly valuable for:

- Enterprise applications handling sensitive data
- Financial services and healthcare systems with strict compliance requirements
- Government and public sector projects needing stringent security measures
- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms isolating client data access

By implementing Network Restrictions, you create a more secure environment for your data, demonstrating a commitment to protection that builds trust with users and stakeholders. This feature provides a crucial first line of defense against unauthorized access attempts, complementing other security measures like strong authentication and encryption.
