Log Drains enable developers to export logs generated by Supabase products—such as the Database, Storage, Realtime, and Auth—to external destinations like Datadog or custom HTTP endpoints. This feature provides a unified view of logs within existing logging and monitoring systems, allowing teams to build robust alerting and observability pipelines.

## Key benefits

1. Centralized logging: Consolidate logs from multiple Supabase services into a single location for easier management and analysis.
2. Custom alerting: Ingest logs into Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to create tailored alerting rules based on database events.
3. Extended retention: Supports longer log retention periods to meet compliance requirements, ensuring data availability for audits and investigations.
4. Flexible configuration: Easily set up Log Drains through the project settings, with support for popular destinations like Datadog and custom HTTP endpoints.
5. Scalable architecture: Built on Logflare's multi-node Elixir cluster, allowing for efficient and scalable log dispatching to multiple destinations.

This feature is particularly useful for teams seeking to enhance their observability practices while maintaining compliance and security standards across their applications.
