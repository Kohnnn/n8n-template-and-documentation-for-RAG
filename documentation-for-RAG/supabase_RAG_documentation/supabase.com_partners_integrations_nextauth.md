## Overview

Open Source Authentication for Next.js.

#### NOTE

This adapter is developed by the community and not officially maintained or supported by Supabase. It uses the Supabase Database to store user and session data in a separate `next_auth` schema. It is a standalone Auth server that does not interface with Supabase Auth and therefore provides a different feature set.

If you’re looking for an officially maintained Auth server with additional features like [built-in email server](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email#configure-email-settings?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), [phone auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-twilio?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), and [Multi Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA)](https://supabase.com/contact/mfa?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), please use [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) with the [Auth Helpers for Next.js](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth).

#### Easy

- Built in support for popular services (Google, Facebook, Auth0, Apple…).
- Built in email / passwordless / magic link. Use with any username / password store.
- Use with OAuth 1.0 & 2.0 services

#### Flexible

- Built for Serverless, runs anywhere.
- Works with your [Supabase Database](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/supabase).
- User and session data is stored in a separate `next_auth` schema within your own database.
- Secure web pages and API routes.

#### Secure

- Signed, prefixed, server-only cookies
- HTTP POST + CSRF Token validation
- JWT with JWS / JWE / JWK
- Tab syncing, auto-revalidation, keepalives
- Doesn't rely on client side JavaScript
