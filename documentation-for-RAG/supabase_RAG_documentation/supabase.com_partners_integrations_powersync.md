## Overview

PowerSync is a Postgres-SQLite sync layer for local-first apps that are instantly reactive, stream data in real-time and work offline.

PowerSync connects to Supabase in a non-invasive way (no schema changes or write permissions required) and streams data to local in-app SQLite database contained in the PowerSync SDK. PowerSync’s Sync Rules allow you to control which data is synced with which users. App reads and writes happen directly against the local database. When writes are made to the local database, the PowerSync SDK places those writes on an upload queue, from where they’re uploaded to the backend (as defined by the developer) as soon as connectivity is available. Custom conflict resolution logic can be applied in the backend API.

PowerSync integrates natively with Supabase Auth, and can easily be added to (or removed from) existing projects.

PowerSync can be self-hosted and is also available as a hosted service (PowerSync Cloud) with a Free plan.
