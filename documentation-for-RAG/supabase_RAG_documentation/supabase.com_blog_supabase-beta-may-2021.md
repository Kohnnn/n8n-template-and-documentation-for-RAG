## Apple logins are now available [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#apple-logins-are-now-available)

Did you know: if you ship an app to the App Store with any third-party logins, you're required to enable Apple logins as well? Now you can with Supabase Auth.

![Apple OAuth is now available in Supabase](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Fsupabase-apple-login.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Twitter logins are now available [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#twitter-logins-are-now-available)

You can also use Twitter as an OAuth provider with Supabase Auth. Twitter has a very archaic OAuth implementation, so this one took awhile.

![Twitter OAuth is now available in Supabase](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Fsupabase-twitter-login.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## New storage policy editor [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#new-storage-policy-editor)

We shipped a new Policy Editor for managing Row Level Security on your Storage. We provide some templates to simplify the process for new developers.

![New Policy Editor](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Fstorage-policies.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Supabase Grid [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#supabase-grid)

We are still working on Open Sourcing our Dashboard, and took another step closer by publicly releasing a new [Supabase Grid](https://github.com/supabase/grid). It's not ready to use outside of the Supabase ecosystem, but over time we hope to make it usable with any Postgres Database.

![This is an image of the new Supabase Grid](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Ftable-grid.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Japan (Tokyo) ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ is now available as a region [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#japan-tokyo--is-now-available-as-a-region)

There are a huge number of Supabase developers in Japan and China, and at their request we've launched Tokyo as a region.

![Tokyo is now availabel as a region](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Fjapan-region.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Return data as CSV [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#return-data-as-csv)

You can now [retrieve your data](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select#return-data-as-csv) as Comma Separated Values. Thanks to [@andreivreja](https://github.com/andreivreja) for the [awesome PR](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/187).

![Download data as a CSV](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Freturn-data-as-csv.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## New Go Libraries [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#new-go-libraries)

The community started developing the Go libraries. [postgrest-go](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-go) is completed, [@Yusuf\_Papurcu](https://twitter.com/Yusuf_Papurcu) and [@muratmirgun](https://twitter.com/muratmirgun) are working on the remaining libraries.

![Supabase Go Libraries](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-may%2Fsupabase-go-support.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## New Swift Libraries [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-may-2021\#new-swift-libraries)

The community started developing the Swift libraries too. [@satishbabariya](https://twitter.com/satishbabariya) is making huge progress on
[`storage-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/storage-swift),
[`gotrue-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-swift),
[`realtime-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-swift), and
[`supabase-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift).
