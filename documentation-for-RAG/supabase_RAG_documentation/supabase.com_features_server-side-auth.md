Supabase's Server-side Auth feature provides tools and utilities for implementing secure user authentication in server-side environments, complementing client-side auth implementations.

## Key features

1. SSR compatibility: Fully supports Server-Side Rendering frameworks.
2. Cookie-based sessions: Store user sessions in cookies instead of local storage for enhanced security.
3. PKCE flow support: Implement the more secure PKCE authentication flow for server-side apps.
4. @supabase/ssr package: Simplified setup for Supabase client in SSR environments (currently in beta).
5. Framework integration: Easily integrate with popular SSR frameworks like Next.js and SvelteKit.

## Benefits:

- Enhanced security: Implement secure token verification and session management on the server.
- Simplified development: Use pre-built helpers to handle common auth tasks, reducing boilerplate code.
- Consistent auth experience: Maintain a unified auth approach across client and server components.
- SSR support: Enable authenticated server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.

## Server-side Auth is valuable for:

- Server-rendered web applications requiring authenticated content
- APIs and microservices needing to verify client authenticity
- Hybrid apps combining client and server-side rendering
- Projects leveraging SSR frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, or SvelteKit
- Applications requiring secure, programmatic access to user session data

Supabase's Server-side Auth feature allows developers to create more secure and robust applications with consistent authentication across both client and server components, adhering to security best practices while leveraging Supabase's auth system.
