![Supabase Beta December 2022](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-01-05-december-beta-update%2Fmonthly-update-december2022.jpg&w=3840&q=100&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

Happy New Year! Hope you are off to a great start. We closed 2022 on a high note with [Launch Week 6](https://supabase.com/launch-week) and a cascade of announcements. Here is everything we shipped so you can try them all üíª

## Day 1: New Docs [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#day-1-new-docs)

![Day 1: New Docs](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-01-05-december-beta-update%2Fdocs.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

Documentation is super important to us, it's part of the product, and the Supabase docs needed a refresh. That's why we worked on a new redesign, better navigation, better reference docs, and we rebuilt the site using Next.js.

- [Video announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Amk6iDlF8)

## Day 2: Storage v2 - Image resizing and Smart CDN [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#day-2-storage-v2---image-resizing-and-smart-cdn)

![Day 2: Storage v2 - Image resizing and Smart CDN](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-01-05-december-beta-update%2Fstorage-v2-image-rezising.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

We introduced three new features for Supabase Storage: Image resizing, webhooks, and a Smart CDN. These features are designed to work together to deliver a next-gen image resizing system.

## Day 3 - Multi-factor Authentication via Row Level Security Enforcement [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#day-3---multi-factor-authentication-via-row-level-security-enforcement)

![Day 3 - Multi-factor Authentication via Row Level Security Enforcement](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-01-05-december-beta-update%2Fmulti-factor-authentication.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

We released Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for everyone, including the option to enforce it via RLS üîê. Plus, in preparation for releasing SAML, we're "dogfooding" the feature with the introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) on our dashboard.

- [Blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/mfa-auth-via-rls)
- [Video announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He7LI2mv9v0)

## Day 4 - Supabase Wrappers, a Postgres FDW framework [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#day-4---supabase-wrappers-a-postgres-fdw-framework)

![Day 4 - Supabase Wrappers, a Postgres FDW framework](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-01-05-december-beta-update%2Fsupabase-wrappers.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

Foreign Data Wrappers are a core feature of PostgreSQL. With Supabase Wrappers, we've extended this feature to query other databases or any other external system (including third-party APIs), using SQL.

## Day 5 - The Vault is now in Beta [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#day-5---the-vault-is-now-in-beta)

It's starting to feel like Supabase is really just a "community of communities" ü§ó. Far too much has happened in the last 3 months for us to possibly feature it all here, so here's a collection of the highlights!

## Postgres Ecosystem [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2022\#postgres-ecosystem)

We are all in on Postgres. That is why contributing to the ecosystem is always a priority. Launch Week 6 was no exception, with several announcements:
