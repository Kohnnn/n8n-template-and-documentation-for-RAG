## Overview

n8n is a connector that helps [integrate Supabase with any other apps](https://n8n.io/integrations/supabase/?utm_source=partners&utm_medium=marketplace-listing&utm_campaign=supabase-may2023) via pre-built nodes or customizable HTTP requests. Supabase's users can build complex workflows with conditional logic and multiple steps. It's like Zapier on steroids but more flexible and versatile.

### **How to integrate Supabase with any app?**

#### **Step 1: Sign up for n8n**

n8n is available as a [Cloud](https://n8n.io/pricing/) service, [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.

#### **Step 2: Add the first step**

Add the starting point â€“ a trigger on when your workflow should run: on an app event, on schedule, on a webhook call, when called by another workflow, or manually.

#### **Step 3: Add nodes**

Add Supabase and other nodes to your workflow canvas. In some situations, Supabase node could already be your first step. Add your credentials for nodes if necessary. Configure them as appropriate. All you have to do is enter the API key. n8n handles the rest of the auth. No reading through docs required.

#### **Step 4: Connect nodes**

A connection establishes a link between Supabase and other nodes to route data through the workflow. A connection between two nodes passes data from one node's output to another node's input. Each node can have one or multiple connections. Use core nodes to manipulate data fields, run custom JavaScript code, transform files, or branch out your flow.

#### **Step 5: Run workflow**

Hit the _**Execute Workflow**_ button, and you are ready to go!
