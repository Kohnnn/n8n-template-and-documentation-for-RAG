# The Medal Ceremony [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/hackathon-winners\#the-medal-ceremony)

We've reached the end of the first ever Supabase Hackathon and the entries have all been incredible. We received way more entrants than expected and therefore it took our judging panel a little longer than expected to get through their deliberations.

Thanks to everyone who joined in, and made this hackathon awesome. We're already looking forward to the next one. But for now, let's dish out some medals.

Don't forget that all the projects here are Open Source, so you can always dive into the code, PR, or fork projects you find interesting.

## Best Overall Project [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/hackathon-winners\#best-overall-project)

### Winner [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/hackathon-winners\#winner)

[Work From](https://github.com/joshcawthorne/work-from) \- by [@cawthornejosh](https://twitter.com/cawthornejosh)

Josh's project allows employees to log which days and hours they'll be working and gives everyone on the team and within the company an overview of who is working when. The animations, UI/UX of this submission combined with the fact that it was built within a single week was absolutely mind-blowing!

[![Work From](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fhackathon-winners%2Fprojects%2Fworkday.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)](https://github.com/joshcawthorne/work-from)

Fireplace makes great use of Supabase Storage for a shared video streaming experience, the killer feature here was the ability to share play, pause, and skip events across multiple users.

Boss work from Richie here - simply add a snippet to your app, then build and manage the components of your application from the Feature dashboard. An amazing example of where no-code is going.

Instagram for Pets! The best bit is all the interactions inside the app are from the perspective of your pet. We were loving the Tamagotchi throwback!
