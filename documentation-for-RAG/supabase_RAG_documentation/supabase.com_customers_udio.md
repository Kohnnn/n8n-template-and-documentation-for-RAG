# Udio hits the right notes with Supabase

Udio built a scalable, AI-driven music platform on a Supabase backend from day one.

[Udio](https://www.udio.com/) is an AI music generation platform that empowers musicians and creators to generate original music using natural language prompts. By combining speed, control, and creative flexibility, Udio makes it easier for anyone to ideate, produce, and remix songs within seconds.

## The challenge [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/udio\#the-challenge)

Udio’s mission is to lower the barrier to music creation. They needed a backend platform that could:

- Help them go from idea to launch with minimal friction
- Support explosive early growth (over a million users in the first month)
- Tie user accounts to complex generation and subscription flows
- Let them iterate quickly while staying focused on core product work

> To realize our vision of an intuitive music generation platform with robust ideation tools, we
> required a backend that allowed us to focus engineering efforts on these core user-facing
> features, rather than on foundational infrastructure complexities. Supabase provided that critical
> abstraction.

## Born on Supabase [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/udio\#born-on-supabase)

Udio launched on Supabase from the beginning. The team had heard positive things from the developer community and found the platform easy to adopt.

> Supabase has been a foundational component of our stack since inception. We launched our platform
> on Supabase and achieved significant user adoption and key milestones within the first month of
> operation.

What stood out was Supabase’s ability to combine database and authentication into a cohesive, developer-friendly experience.

> For us, a key differentiator was Supabase’s integrated solution for authentication and database
> services. This cohesion significantly streamlined our development workflows and accelerated our
> engineering velocity.

Recently, Udio launched their mobile application. They were able to move quickly thanks to a shared authentication backend with the website. The quality of Supabase’s documentation and support was instrumental in helping them maintain their development velocity.

## The approach [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/udio\#the-approach)

Udio started with a lightweight proof of concept using the Supabase client libraries and dashboard. Without needing a complex backend, they were able to get their product into users’ hands quickly. As the company scaled, they expanded their use of Supabase’s more advanced features.

Supabase is the system of record for user and app data:

- [Supabase Database](https://supabase.com/database) as their core operational data layer
- [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) to manage secure access and subscription gating

And, when the team encountered edge cases with query handling, Supabase support stepped in directly.

> We collaborated extensively with the Supabase technical support team, conducting in-depth analyses
> of both our application code and Supabase’s underlying infrastructure to identify and resolve
> complex performance issues.

## The results [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/udio\#the-results)

Since launching in April 2024, Udio has scaled to millions of users. Supabase played a foundational role in enabling this growth.

- Fast prototyping allowed them to validate the product with minimal backend complexity
- Supabase Auth streamlined critical flows tied to user accounts and paid features
- The Admin API reduced friction for high-volume customer support cases
- Support from the Supabase team helped resolve scaling and query issues as they emerged

> Supabase empowered us to maintain rapid iteration cycles and concentrate our engineering resources
> on core product development, ultimately enabling us to deliver maximum value to our users.
