## Overview

Buster is an open source alternative to Tableau, built from the ground up with AI in mind.

With Buster, anyone can query data using plain english, generate robust visualizations, and build their own dashboards. It works like this...

Connect your Supabase database with one click. Buster will then generate documentation around your db and help you build analytics-ready datasets (models/views).

Once your datasets are published, users are able to ask data questions in plain english, generate visualizations, and build their own dashboards on the fly.
