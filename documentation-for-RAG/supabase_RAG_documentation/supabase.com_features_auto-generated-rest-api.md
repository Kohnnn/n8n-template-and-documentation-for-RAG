Supabase automatically generates a comprehensive RESTful API from your database schema, powered by PostgREST. This feature dramatically accelerates development by eliminating the need to write boilerplate server-side code for basic CRUD operations.

## Key benefits

1. Rapid development: Instantly access your data through a RESTful API without writing any backend code.
2. Automatic updates: API endpoints automatically reflect changes in your database schema, ensuring consistency.
3. Flexible querying: Use powerful query parameters to filter, sort, and paginate data directly from API calls.
4. Custom operations: Easily expose custom database functions as API endpoints for complex operations.
5. Secure by default: Leverage Postgres's role-based access control for built-in API security.
6. Performance: Benefit from PostgREST's optimized query execution for efficient API responses.
7. Standardized interface: Work with a well-documented, consistent API across all your database tables.
