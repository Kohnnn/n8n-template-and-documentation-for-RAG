[Mendable](http://mendable.ai/) provides a chat-powered search engine for technical documentation. Their AI-powered search tool makes it easier for developers and other technical users to find relevant information in complex documentation. Users can simply ask questions in natural language, and the tool returns the most relevant answers. Mendable's search engine also provides detailed analytics, which helps teams identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement in their documentation. Mendable has integrated with some of the largest open source projects in the space such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.

## The Challenge [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/mendableai\#the-challenge)

Mendable was experiencing tremendous success, growing Weekly Active Users by nearly 300% since March. They needed a tool to store and search through large amounts of vector data to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their similarity search operations. They tried Faiss, Weaviate, and Pinecone, but found them to be expensive and not very intuitive, especially when it came to storing metadata along with the vectors.

## Why they chose Supabase [\#](https://supabase.com/customers/mendableai\#why-they-chose-supabase)

Mendable lear that Supabase supports [pgvector](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector) and found it to be a simple and cost-effective solution. They were impressed with the open source nature of Supabase, as well as its ability to store metadata alongside the vectors. They also appreciated the intuitive interface and ease of use.

> We tried other vector databases - we tried Faiss, we tried Weaviate, we tried Pinecone. We found
> them to be incredibly expensive and not very intuitive. If you're just doing vector search they're
> great, but if you need to store a bunch of metadata that becomes a huge pain.
