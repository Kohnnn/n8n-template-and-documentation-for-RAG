You can now add users manually from your dashboard.

### User admin [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-november-2020\#user-admin)

You can also perform admin functions on existing users - send password reset emails, magic links, and delete users.

### Even more powerful SQL Editor [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-november-2020\#even-more-powerful-sql-editor)

Last month we [announced](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020#more-powerful-sql-editor) an improved SQL Editor, and this month we've taken it even further. The SQL Editor is now a full Monaco editor, like you'd find in VS Code. Build your database directly from the browser.

### Status page [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-november-2020\#status-page)

We added a [Status Page](https://status.supabase.com/) which tracks the uptime and latency of the Supabase platform.
