In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

It may seem crazy to do another launch week just four months later, but we couldn't give up on a good pun, so get ready for **Launch Week II: the SQL**.

## What to expect [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql\#what-to-expect)

Just like last time, we don't want to spoil the surprise. So for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect. Come back each day to see what we launch, or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date: [@supabase](https://twitter.com/supabase) and follow the hashtag [#supalaunchweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supalaunchweek).

## Monday 26 July: Community Day [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql\#monday-26-july-community-day)

### What? [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql\#what)

One of the best things about building Supabase is the community. We're even luckier because we're an amalgamation of tools like Postgres and PostgREST. We're starting the week by shining a spotlight on some of the latest developments from the community.

What's cooler than Arnie in the 90's? Passwordless logins. We've [already](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-apple) [built](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-bitbucket) [support](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-discord) [for](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-facebook) [eight](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github) [different](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-gitlab) [Oauth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google) [providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-twitter), so it's anyone's guess what can happen in Supabase Auth Episode II.
