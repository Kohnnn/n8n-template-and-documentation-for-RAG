Brace yourself, this is one of the most feature-packed Beta Updates we've published so far.

[Launch Week 7](https://supabase.com/launch-week) was a massive success with great feedback from the community. We also gave away lots of mechanical keyboards, including the Hackathon winner which we announce here!

## Day 1 - Supabase Logs: open source logging server [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-update-april-2023\#day-1---supabase-logs-open-source-logging-server)

![Day 1 - Supabase Logs: open source logging server](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2023-05-09-beta-update-april%2Fnewsletter-OG-day-1.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

Logflare is the hub of analytics streams for Supabase. We are open sourcing it so that you can self-host your own Logging infrastructure.

You can now self-host Edge Functions and run them in local development using our new Edge Runtime. We published a guide showing how to self-host Edge Functions with Fly and what more is coming

On day 4, we introduced SSO with SAML 2.0, PKCE, and Sign in with Apple for iOS. It felt like acronym day, but it was actually Auth day!
