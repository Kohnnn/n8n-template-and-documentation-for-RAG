# Nordcraft

## Overview

Nordcraft is the world’s first Web Development Engine.

The Nordraft Web Development Engine is visual tooling applied to a lean framework built on web standards. Think Unreal Engine, but for crafting impressive high-end web applications that delight your users. Plus, Nordcraft is open source. Choose to host your apps on Nordcraft’s platform, or self-host the lightweight 24kb runtime for complete control.

Nordcraft gives you a complete set of developer tools including:

- An official Supabase integration
- Connect to any backend API, with enhanced provision for APIs using an OpenAPI spec
- Branching and version control
- Component-based architecture familiar to React, Vue, and Svelte developers
- Visual editing of UI components and design systems familiar to designers working in Figma
- Server-side rendering as standard
- Fast reactive core based on signals
- Package publishing for code reusability across projects
- Custom code abilities via the built-in code editor
- A state-of-the-art animation editor
- An issue tracker to flag accessibility, SEO, and other issues
- Open source documentation

The Nordcraft Engine lets designers and developers collaborate faster to create immersive and interactive web experiences, eliminating design to dev handovers. Work with live data in the Nordcraft editor and see your changes in real time, and send a live preview link of your work in progress to anyone.

And to showcase the power of the Web Development Engine, we built Nordcraft in Nordcraft.
