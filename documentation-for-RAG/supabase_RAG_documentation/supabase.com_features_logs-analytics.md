The Logs & Analytics feature in Supabase provides users with comprehensive logging and analytics capabilities, powered by Logflare. This tool enables developers to track and analyze log events from various Supabase services, such as the API gateway, Postgres databases, Storage, Edge Functions, and more. By leveraging a multi-node Elixir cluster, Supabase processes billions of log events daily, ensuring that users have access to critical insights for optimizing their applications.

## Key benefits

1. Real-Time Monitoring: Access live data on application performance and user interactions to make informed decisions.
2. Comprehensive Log Management: Ingest and store logs from multiple sources, allowing for centralized management of application events.
3. Powerful Querying: Utilize SQL queries through Logflare Endpoints to analyze logs efficiently, enabling users to extract meaningful metrics.
4. Customizable Dashboards: Create tailored views within Supabase Studio to visualize log data and track key performance indicators (KPIs).
5. Scalability: Handle large volumes of log data with a robust infrastructure designed for high availability and performance.

This feature is particularly valuable for teams looking to enhance their application's reliability and performance by gaining deeper insights into usage patterns and potential issues.
