## Vercel integration [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#vercel-integration)

Vercel just released their new integrations, which means you can now deploy a Postgres database on Supabase directly from your Vercel account.
Check it out! [vercel.com/integrations/supabase](https://vercel.com/integrations/supabase)

![Supabase Vercel Integration](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fsupabase-vercel.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Discord logins are now available [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#discord-logins-are-now-available)

Building a community? There's almost no better tool than Discord (we're even trialling it ourselves).
If you're building a community product, Discord logins are the perfect option.

![Discord logins](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fsupabase-discord.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## New Guides [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#new-guides)

We spent the month building up a new [Guides section](https://supabase.com/docs/guides) in our Docs. Here are a few highlights:

### Postgres Full Text Search [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#postgres-full-text-search)

Ever wanted to build a Search Engine? We just released a guide which shows you how to implement
[Full Text Search using Postgres](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/full-text-search).

![Postgres Full Text Search](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fpostgres-fts.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

### OAuth Guides [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#oauth-guides)

We released step-by-step guides to help you set up OAuth with
[Apple](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-apple),
[Bitbucket](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-bitbucket),
[Facebook](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-facebook),
[GitHub](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github),
[GitLab](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-gitlab),
[Google](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google), and
[Twitter](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-twitter).

### Javascript + Postgres [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#javascript--postgres)

Did you know that you can use Javascript inside your Postgres database? Here's how, with the
[`plv8` extension](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/plv8).

![Postgres and Javascript with plv8](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fsupabase-plv8.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Public Storage Buckets [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#public-storage-buckets)

Want to share all your favourite memes? Now it's even easier with Public Storage Buckets. Simply mark a bucket as
"Public" and the content will be accessible without a login.

## Storage upserts [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#storage-upserts)

Supabase Storage now supports `upsert`. Shoutout to [@ankitjena](https://github.com/ankitjena) for
[this Pull Request](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api/pull/32).

![Storage now supports upserts](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fsupabase-storage-upsert.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Server restarts [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#server-restarts)

When things go wrong, sometime the best thing you can do is reboot. We released a restart button in the Dashboard,
the first of many debugging tools we'll be releasing over the next few months.

![You can now restart you Supabase servers](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fserver-restarts.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Policy editor [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#policy-editor)

We added a new Table Policy Editor which makes Row Level Security even easier. We even included a few templates to get you started.

![New editor for Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2F2021-june%2Fpolicy-editor.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

## Build in Public [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-june-2021\#build-in-public)

We run a weekly 1-hour live stream where we build in public.
