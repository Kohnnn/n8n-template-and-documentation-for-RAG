every day for an entire week.

If this is your first Launch Week, check out our previous Launch Weeks for a taste of what's to come:

This Community Day is going to be our biggest one yet.

### What? [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four\#what-4)

Absolutely, definitely not an April Fool's joke. Friday is reserved for ‚Äúone more thing(s)‚Äù -
a secret announcement of some sort. There's always too much to ship in a week, so let's be honest -
it's never really just _one_ more thing.

### What [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four\#what-5)

Finally, we're continuing our tradition of wrapping up Launch Week by rolling into a 10-day virtual Hackathon.
As always, you'll have the chance to win extremely limited Supabase Swag,
and you'll be able to play around with the new features we're about to launch.

We're also delighted to be partnering with [the future forest company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com/)
to plant a tree for every project that is being submitted for the Hackathon.
So let's build some cool open-source projects and a forest at the same time!

### When [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four\#when-5)

Friday 1 April 2022: 9:00am PT - Sunday 9 April 11:59pm PT

### Where [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four\#where-5)

We're extremely excited to see what you'll build and can't wait to dive into your submissions on
[madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/).
