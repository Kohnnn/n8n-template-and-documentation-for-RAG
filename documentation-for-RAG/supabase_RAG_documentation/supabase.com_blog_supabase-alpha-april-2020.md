## Important Notes [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-april-2020\#important-notes)

1/ Supabase is NOT production ready. Have a play around and let us know what you think. We don't track ANYTHING (although we do store your github name and email). We'd like to keep it that way, so we rely on your direct feedback to steer our product roadmap.

2/ We are free to use while we're in alpha thanks to the generosity of Digital Ocean's startup program. But the funds aren't unlimited - please shut down the database when you're done :pray:.

3/ The database takes about 2 minutes to build. It's worth it, we promise. If you've ever wanted use Postgres, we're the easiest in the market.

## Coming soon [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-april-2020\#coming-soon)

At Supabase, we're building some amazing tools that make Postgres as easy to use as Firebase. Some of the things we're working on:

#### Simple interface [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-april-2020\#simple-interface)

Why are database interfaces so hard to use? The Supabase team has built products for 70-year-olds, so we're confident we can make something easier for developers:

#### Connectors [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-april-2020\#connectors)

Send realtime database changes to other systems, like queues or webhooks (Slack notifications!):
