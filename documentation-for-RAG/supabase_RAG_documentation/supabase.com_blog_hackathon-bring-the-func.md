We canâ€™t believe that itâ€™s already a wrap on our [fourth launch week](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four)! To keep the party and excitement going, and as [is now tradition](https://supabase.com/blog/community-day#launch-week-iv---what-to-expect), starting at 9am PT today we'll be hacking together for the next 10 days until 23:59pm PT on Sunday April 10th. And because weâ€™ve launched [GraphQL support](https://supabase.com/blog/graphql-now-available) and [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-enterprise), these will be the major themes and therefore categories for the hackathon.

For some inspiration, check out [TheGuildDev](https://twitter.com/TheGuildDev)â€™s [GraphQL HackerNews clone](https://supabase-graphql-example.vercel.app/), and [Tylerâ€™s](https://twitter.com/dshukertjr) [Flutter](https://github.com/supabase-community/flutter-stripe-payments-with-supabase-functions) and [Thorâ€™s](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) [React Native](https://github.com/supabase-community/expo-stripe-payments-with-supabase-functions) apps with Supabase Edge Functions, or have a browse through [madewithsupabase.com](http://madewithsupabase.com/)!

As always, we'll have some extremely limited edition swag to give away that can only be won by participating in the Hackathon!
