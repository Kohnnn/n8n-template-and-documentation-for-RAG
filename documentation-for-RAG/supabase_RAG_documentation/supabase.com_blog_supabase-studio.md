Today we're releasing [Supabase Studio](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/studio).
The same Dashboard that you're using on our Platform is now available for [Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development)
and [Self-Hosting](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/hosting/overview).

## Background [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#background)

Let's get the obvious question out of the way - why wasn't it already open source?

When Ant and I started Supabase the codebase was one large monorepo which contained everything from the dashboard to cloud infrastructure code to experimental code.
This is our preferred development setup - we like to keep all code in one place so that we have a single source of truth and tightly coupled CI workflows.

The original Dashboard really wasn't much except a couple of buttons which allowed our Alpha users to start and stop a Supabase project - back then only a PostgreSQL connection string.

Then time went on, and we started gaining traction - a lot faster than expected.
The nice thing about building for developers is that they are very vocal about the features they want to see next.
And so we kept shipping - a SQL editor, a Table view, User management, auto-generated Docs, and everything else you can find on the Dashboard today.

We've been planning to make the Dashboard public for a long time now, starting with [Supabase UI](https://ui.supabase.com/),
[`supabase/grid`](https://github.com/supabase/grid), and a standalone [PR](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/2281) for Supabase Studio.
But as feature requests kept rolling in it became a Sisyphean task to maintain separate code bases.

After the last Launch Week, we decided to prioritize the Studio.

## Approaches for managing shared codebases [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#approaches-for-managing-shared-codebases)

We investigated a few different approaches used in the open source world. There are three popular strategies that we found amongst OSS projects and some of our YC alum:

- Maintain separate code bases. Pluck changes from one to another.
- Keep two repos in sync using some mixture of git submodules or a tool like [copycat](https://github.com/atomix/copycat)
- Use the same codebase, abstracting platform-specific code behind an API and feature flags.

Our frontend [team](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/teams/frontend/members) experimented with the first two approaches where they plucked (injected, merged, and wrangled) code for our Platform.
Time-to-production become a lot slower, an unacceptable outcome at Supabase.

Eventually we decided to open source all the frontend code, a shared codebase for both the Platform and Self Hosting.

Special shout out

Sentry do a fantastic job of [documenting their strategy](https://develop.sentry.dev/sentry-vs-getsentry/) for managing a shared codebase and served as a great model for Supabase.

## Build in public [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#build-in-public)

For the past week, the dashboard you've been using on the Platform has been deployed from our [main repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/studio).

This fits one of our core philosophies at Supabase: do less. Less code to manage means less bugs. Fewer codebases means faster shipping.

It also fits the development philosophy of every other part of Supabase: building in public, "warts and all".

This is a huge step forward for the community. Supabase users can now spot a bug, fix it in the open source repository,
and have it shipped to both the Platform and Self-Hosted environments - all in a few hours.

## Technical details [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#technical-details)

Let's jump into some of the technical implementation for Supabase Studio.

### Tech stack [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#tech-stack)

Studio is a Javascript application with a few key pieces of technology:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) \- A frontend Javascript framework built with React.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) \- A utility-first CSS framework.
- [Supabase UI](https://ui.supabase.com/) \- Our own component library.
- [MobX](https://www.mobxjs.com/) \- A state management library.
- A host of other [useful libraries](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/studio/package.json), including [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Lottiefiles](https://lottiefiles.com/), [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout), and [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn).

### What's included [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-studio\#whats-included)

Studio is designed to work with existing deployments - either the local hosted, docker setup, or our CLI.
It is not intended for managing the deployment and administration of projects - that's out of scope.

The features exposed on Studio for existing deployments are limited to those which manage your database:

- Table & SQL editors. (Saved queries are unavailable for now)
- Database management: Policies, roles, extensions, replication.
- API documentation.

Over time we'll expose a lot more of the codebase in the self-hosted Dashboard, this was as much as we could do for this Launch Week!
