Vault is a Postgres extension and accompanying Supabase UI that simplifies the secure storage of encrypted secrets and other sensitive data in your database. This feature allows developers to utilize Postgres in innovative ways beyond its standard capabilities.

## Key benefits:

1. Secure storage: Secrets are stored on disk in an encrypted format, ensuring they remain protected even in backups or replication streams.
2. Easy management: The Supabase dashboard UI makes it simple to store and manage secrets, including environment variables and API keys.
3. Flexible encryption: Users can create custom encryption keys for different purposes, enhancing data security.
4. Seamless access: Secrets can be accessed from SQL as easily as querying a table, facilitating their use in Postgres Functions, Triggers, and Webhooks.
5. Robust security features: The Vault employs authenticated encryption to ensure that secrets cannot be forged or decrypted without proper authorization.

This feature is particularly useful for teams looking to enhance their security posture by managing sensitive data directly within their database environment.
