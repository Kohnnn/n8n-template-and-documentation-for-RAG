We live in a world where data is as critical as air and water, powering everything from global enterprises to personal projects. At Supabase, we create products that are not just cutting-edge but also secure, reliable, and now, timeless.

Today, we are excited to introduce a groundbreaking service that bridges the digital divide with the most enduring medium known to humankind: paper. Meet [pg\_paper\_dump](https://github.com/supabase-community/pg_paper_dump), Supabase’s answer to the ultimate data preservation conundrum.

## Why Paper? [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-paper-dump\#why-paper)

In the digital era, the threat landscape is constantly evolving, with new vulnerabilities emerging at a pace that's hard to keep up with. While digital backups are the norm, they are susceptible to cyber-attacks, hardware failures, and obsolescence.

This vulnerability led us to think outside the digital box and into a realm that is impervious to hacking, immune to electromagnetic pulses, and resistant to time itself: physical paper.

Historical data backup on Papyrus that inspired `pg_paper_dump`.

## How does `pg_paper_dump` work? [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-paper-dump\#how-does-pg_paper_dump-work)

### Backup Process [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-paper-dump\#backup-process)

1. **Select Your Data:** Choose the databases you wish to back up with `pg_paper_dump`.
2. **Encode and Print:** Our system encodes your data with Comic Sans and prints it onto durable paper.
3. **Secure Storage:** We store your paper backups in a location of your choice or utilize our secure Arctic Vault for maximum security.

### Restoration Process [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-paper-dump\#restoration-process)

1. **Select your recovery point:** Thanks to point-in-time recovery, we can restore your data up until any specific page.
2. **Restore:** Our Mechanical Turks are trained to decode data encoded in Comic Sans and will input your data with reasonable human-accuracy into your destination database.

### Scaling data preservation with containers [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-paper-dump\#scaling-data-preservation-with-containers)

Our Analog Engineering team has developed a container orchestration protocol to coordinate the backup and restore process of large databases.
