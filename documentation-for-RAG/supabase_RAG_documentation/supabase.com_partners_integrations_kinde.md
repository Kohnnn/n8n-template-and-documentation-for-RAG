## Overview

Auth for modern applications. Powerful user authentication that integrates in minutes.

Kinde handles user authentication, manages session tokens, and offers user management features, which can be integrated with the authorization mechanisms provided by Supabase, utilizing PostgreSQLâ€™s Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

We will explore how to connect and leverage a Supabase database with the capabilities of Kinde, an authentication and authorization provider.

- Kinde setup
- Supabase setup
- Integration
- Creating a sample To-Do application that leverages both systems
