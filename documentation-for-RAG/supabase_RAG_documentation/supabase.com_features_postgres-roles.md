Postgres Roles are a fundamental aspect of managing access permissions within your Supabase database. Roles can function as individual users or groups of users, allowing for flexible permission management. This feature is essential for setting up secure access to your database while enabling efficient collaboration among team members.

Key benefits:

1. Granular access control: Configure permissions for various database objects, including tables, views, and functions, using the GRANT command.
2. Role hierarchy: Organize roles in a hierarchy to simplify permission management, allowing child roles to inherit permissions from parent roles.
3. Secure user management: Create roles with specific login privileges and strong passwords to ensure secure access to your database.
4. Revocation of permissions: Easily revoke permissions using the REVOKE command, providing control over who has access to what within your database.
5. Predefined Roles: Supabase extends Postgres with a set of predefined roles, simplifying the initial setup for new projects.

This feature is particularly valuable for teams looking to implement robust security measures while maintaining flexibility in how users interact with their database.
