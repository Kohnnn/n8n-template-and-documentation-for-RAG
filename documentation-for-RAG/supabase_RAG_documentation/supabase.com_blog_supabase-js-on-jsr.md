![Announcing Supabase on JSR](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fjsr_supabase%2Fjsr_supabase.png&w=3840&q=100&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

[JSR](https://jsr.io/) is a modern [open source](https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr) JavaScript registry that simplifies publishing and importing JavaScript and TypeScript modules. JSR supports publishing TypeScript source code, auto-generating documentation and type definition files, provenance attestation for more security, and can be used with npm-like package managers. Since its launch, over 250 new packages are being published each week.

We're thrilled to announce that our [JavaScript client library](https://jsr.io/@supabase/supabase-js) is now available on JSR.

As many of you know, our JavaScript library, `supabase-js`, is composed of [many sub-clients](https://github.com/supabase-community#client-libraries) that let you query your Supabase [database](https://supabase.com/database), subscribe to [real-time events](https://supabase.com/realtime), upload and download [files](https://supabase.com/storage), manage [auth](https://supabase.com/auth), invoke Deno powered [Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions), and [more](https://supabase.com/vector). It's fully isomorphic and can be used across any environment that speaks JavaScript and HTTPS, such as browsers, servers, and [the edge](https://deno.com/blog/the-future-of-web-is-on-the-edge)!

Using supabase-js via JSR offers an excellent developer experience, with first class TypeScript support, auto-generated documentation accessible in your code editor, and more.

## Installing Supabase [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-js-on-jsr\#installing-supabase)

You can get started with Supabase using the `deno add` command:

`
deno add @supabase/supabase-js
`

Or using npm:

`
npx jsr add @supabase/supabase-js
`

The above commands will generate a `deno.json` file, listing all your project dependencies.

deno.json

`
{
"imports": {
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "jsr:@supabase/supabase-js@2"
}
}
`

You can then import the client library to your `main.ts` file:

main.ts

`
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')
console.log('Supabase Instance: ', supabase)
`

Finally, you can run the following command to execute:

`
deno run -A main.ts
`

Check out the [`supabase-js` README](https://jsr.io/@supabase/supabase-js) to see how to use it in other environments.

With the Supabase client on JSR, you can easily and quickly add authentication or persistent storage to your projects, which can run in any JavaScript environment!
