2. Flexible enrollment: API for building custom MFA setup interfaces.
3. Challenge and Verify APIs: Securely validate user access to additional factors.
4. Authenticator Assurance Levels: JWT claims (aal1, aal2) to indicate the level of identity verification.
5. Customizable enforcement: Options to enforce MFA for all users, new users only, or opt-in basis.
6. Database integration: Row Level Security policies to enforce MFA rules at the database level.

## Benefits:

- Enhanced security: Significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized account access.
