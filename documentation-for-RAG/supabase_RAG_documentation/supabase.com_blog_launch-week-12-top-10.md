![Top 10 Launches of Launch Week 12](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Flw12%2Fday-5%2Fthumb_top-10-lw.png&w=3840&q=100&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

There's always a lot to cover in Launch Weeks. Here are the top 10, ranked by my own statistical reasoning.

### \#10 Snaplet is now open source [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#10-snaplet-is-now-open-source)

Snaplet is now closed, but their source code is open. They are releasing 3 tools under the MIT license for copying data, seeding databases, and taking database snapshots.

### \#9 pg\_replicate [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#9-pg_replicate)

Use pg\_replicate to copy data (full table copies and CDC) from Postgres to any other data system. Today it supports BigQuery, DuckDb, and MotherDuck, with more sinks will be added in future.

[See it on HackerNews.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41209994)

### \#8 vec2pg [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#8-vec2pg)

A new CLI utility for migrating data from vector databases to Supabase, or any Postgres instance with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector). Today it works with Pinecone and Qdrant - more will be added in future.

### \#7 Official Supabase extension for VS Code and GitHub Copilot [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#7-official-supabase-extension-for-vs-code-and-github-copilot)

We launched a new GitHub Copilot extension for VS Code to make your development with Supabase and VS Code even more delightful.

### \#6 Python official support [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#6-python-official-support)

Python libs are now officially supported in Supabase. We've seen a huge rise in Python developers (and contributors) driven mostly by AI and ML, and this will make it easier for them to use Supabase.

### \#5 We released Log Drains [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#5-we-released-log-drains)

We released Log Drains so that developers can export logs generated by their Supabase products to external destinations, such as Datadog or custom HTTP endpoints.

### \#4 Realtime: Broadcast and Presence Authorization [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#4-realtime-broadcast-and-presence-authorization)

We added authorization for Realtime's Broadcast and Presence. You write RLS Policies to allow or deny clients' access to your Broadcast and Presence Channels.

[Read more.](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-realtime-broadcast-and-presence-authorization)

### \#3 Auth: Bring-your-own Auth0, Cognito, or Firebase [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#3-auth-bring-your-own-auth0-cognito-or-firebase)

This was actually a few different announcements: support for third-party Auth providers; Phone-based Multi-factor Authentication (SMS and Whatsapp); and new Auth Hooks for SMS and email.

### \#2 Build Postgres Wrappers with Wasm [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#2-build-postgres-wrappers-with-wasm)

Today we're releasing support for [Wasm (WebAssembly)](https://webassembly.org/) Foreign Data Wrapper. With this feature, anyone can create a FDW and share it with the Supabase community. You can build Postgres interfaces to anything on the internet.

[Read more.](https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-foreign-data-wrappers-with-wasm)

### \#1: postgres.new: In-browser Postgres with an AI interface [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#1-postgresnew-in-browser-postgres-with-an-ai-interface)

[database.build](https://database.build/) (formerly postgres.new) is an in-browser Postgres sandbox with AI assistance. With database.build, you can instantly spin up an unlimited number of Postgres databases that run directly in your browser (and soon, deploy them to S3).

## One more thing: a Supabase Book [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-12-top-10\#one-more-thing-a-supabase-book)

There's now an entire book written about Supabase. [David Lorenz](https://x.com/activenode) spent a year working on it and we think it's one of the most thorough Supabase resources on the internet. If you're interested in leveling up your Supabase skills, you can support David and [purchase the book here](https://supa.guide/).
