## About this event

## Keep Your Fauna Applications by Migrating to Supabase [\#](https://supabase.com/events/fauna-to-supabase-migration\#keep-your-fauna-applications-by-migrating-to-supabase)

The deadline to move off Fauna is approaching fast. In this 45-minute session, you'll learn how to move your data to Supabase, modify your FQL queries for SQL, and optimize your deployment. Bree has navigated this transition from Fauna to Supabase already and will be on hand to provide advice and best practices. This is a hands-on demonstration and will include plenty of time for Q&A.
