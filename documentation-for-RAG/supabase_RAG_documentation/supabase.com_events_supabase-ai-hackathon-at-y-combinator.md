## About this event

On November 22 and 23 we're hosting an AI-focused hackathon at [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) in San Francisco.

We've already seen [several 1M+ user AI applications](https://x.com/kiwicopple/status/1754777201092784209) built on Supabase and are hosting this event to support the next wave. YC has generously offered to host the event and will be there to judge projects alongside Supabase founders Copple and Ant.

[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) is also supporting the hackathon and will provide credits to every team.

**This event is full and invite only.**
