Supabase's Postgres SSL Enforcement feature allows you to mandate SSL connections to your database, enhancing security by encrypting data in transit and protecting against potential attacks.

## Key features

1. Optional enforcement: Enable or disable SSL requirements to balance security and client compatibility.
2. Comprehensive protection: Applies to both direct Postgres and connection pooler (Supavisor) connections.
3. Flexible configuration: Manage settings via Dashboard or CLI.
4. Support for various SSL modes: Including the highly secure 'verify-full' mode.

## Benefits:

- Data encryption: Protect all information transmitted between your application and the database.
- Integrity assurance: Prevent data tampering during transmission.
- Authentication: Ensure connections are made to the genuine database server.
- Compliance support: Meet industry standards and regulatory requirements for data protection.
- Simplified security: Automatically enforce best practices for secure database connections.

## SSL Enforcement is particularly valuable for:

- Applications handling sensitive user data
- Financial services requiring secure transactions
- Healthcare applications managing patient information
- E-commerce platforms processing payment data
- Any application prioritizing data privacy and integrity

By enabling SSL Enforcement, you implement a fundamental best practice in data protection. This feature ensures that every interaction with your database is encrypted and secure, whether from application servers, admin tools, or API calls.
