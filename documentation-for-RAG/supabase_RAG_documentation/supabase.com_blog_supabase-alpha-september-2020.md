We're now 7 months into building Supabase. This update is a big one!

### Third-party logins [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#third-party-logins)

We've released OAuth logins! You can now enable third-party logins on your app for Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, or Google.

![This is a picture of the supabase dashboard with OAuth logins](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fsupabase-oauth-logins.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

### Clone tables [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#clone-tables)

You can duplicate your tables, just like you would inside a spreadsheet.

### Enable and disable extensions [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#enable-and-disable-extensions)

Extensions are easier to use. You can enable Postgres extensions with the click of a button.

### Save your favorite queries [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#save-your-favorite-queries)

The SQL editor now stores your query history in your browser. You can also save your favorite queries to run later!

### GitHub Discussions [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#github-discussions)

Supabase was given access to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions)! This is the place for you to ask questions or show off what you've built with Supabase.

![This is a screenshot of our GitHub Discussions, a new feature by GitHub.](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fsupabase-github-discussions.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

### Kaizen [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#kaizen)

- Our dashboard now uses [Next.js automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) \- so it should be noticeably more responsive.
- We created an Isomorphic [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/) TypeScript library for interacting with Netlify's [GoTrue server](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue). This will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`
- We migrated our [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/) library to TypeScript, and it will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`

### From the community [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#from-the-community)

- @kiwicopple [appeared on GitHub's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/github/video/751281550) for Open Source Friday with @MishManners
- @kiwicopple [discussed pricing for Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLhI6cccBQA) with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij
- @Thorwebdev [presented Supabase Auth at the SingaporeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUMxJ4w-MUU) meetup

- [postgrest-dart](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-dart) was shipped by [@phamhieu](https://github.com/phamhieu)
- [postgrest-csharp](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-csharp) is being implemented by [@acupofjose](https://github.com/acupofjose)

### Hacktoberfest [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#hacktoberfest)

There's been [plenty of drama](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) during Hacktoberfest, but Supabase is committed to helping new contributors get started with open source. We've already seen a lot of issues closed by new members to our community and first-time contributors. If you're looking for ways to get involved, read our Hacktoberfest [blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-hacktoberfest-2020), check our [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xRLTjvEiE&t=60s), and then dive into our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/projects/5).

### Coming next [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-september-2020\#coming-next)

Our focus now is to move from Alpha to Beta and we'll be improving stability, reliability, and performance. We've created a [Benchmarks](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks/) repository, where we'll be measuring the performance of all the open source tools we use.
