In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

In July we did [Launch Week II: The SQL](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql), with another week of feature releases.

Santa's little hackers have been hard at work because we've got another five days of launches ready to go.
