Supabase's Realtime Postgres Changes feature allows you to listen to database changes in real-time using the Realtime system. This capability enables you to build responsive, live-updating applications that reflect database changes instantly.

## Key features

1. Event-based listening: Subscribe to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or all (\*) events.
2. Schema and table targeting: Listen to changes in specific schemas or tables.
3. Granular filtering: Apply filters to receive only relevant changes.
4. Multiple subscriptions: Listen to different combinations of events, schemas, and tables in a single channel.
5. Row-level security integration: Respect database permissions when broadcasting changes.

## Benefits:

- Real-time updates: Receive instant notifications when data changes, enabling live-updating UIs.
- Efficient data syncing: Keep client-side data in sync with the database without constant API calls.
- Flexible subscriptions: Tailor your subscriptions to specific events, schemas, tables, or conditions.
- Improved user experience: Provide users with up-to-date information without page refreshes.
- Simplified architecture: Implement real-time features without separate messaging systems.

## Postgres Changes are valuable for:

- Collaborative applications where multiple users work on shared data
- Real-time dashboards and analytics platforms
- Live chat and messaging systems
- Applications requiring instant updates based on database changes

Supabase's Realtime Postgres Changes feature provides a powerful tool for creating responsive, real-time applications while leveraging the full capabilities of your Postgres database.
