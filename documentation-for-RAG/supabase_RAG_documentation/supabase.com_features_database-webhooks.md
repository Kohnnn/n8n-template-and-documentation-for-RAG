Database Webhooks allow you to send real-time data from your database to another system whenever a table event occurs. You can hook into three table events: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, with all events fired after a database row is changed. This feature provides a convenient way to integrate your Supabase database with external applications and services.

## Key benefits

1. Real-time data transfer: Automatically send data to external systems in response to database changes, ensuring timely updates.
2. Flexibility: Configure webhooks for specific tables and events, allowing for tailored integrations based on your application's needs.
3. Asynchronous processing: Built on the pg\_net extension, webhooks operate asynchronously, preventing long-running network requests from blocking database operations.
4. Easy setup: Create webhooks directly from the Supabase Dashboard or through SQL statements, making integration straightforward.
5. Payload customization: Automatically generated payloads provide relevant data about the event, including the new and old record states.

This feature is particularly useful for developers looking to automate workflows and integrate their databases with third-party services like payment processors or notification systems.
