Supavisor is a cloud-native connection pooler designed for Postgres, built to handle millions of connections efficiently. It was developed in Elixir and integrates advanced features such as query load balancing, named prepared statement support, and query cancellation. Supavisor enhances the performance of Postgres by managing connections effectively, ensuring that applications can scale seamlessly under heavy loads.

## Key benefits:

1. Scalable Architecture: Supports high concurrency and rapid I/O, making it suitable for applications with significant connection demands.
2. Query Load Balancing: Automatically distributes read requests across primary and replica servers to optimize performance.
3. Named Prepared Statements: Allows clients to reuse query plans across connections, improving efficiency and reducing overhead.
4. Query Cancellation: Provides the ability to cancel long-running queries easily, enhancing user experience during database interactions.
5. Easy Integration: New Supabase projects come with a Supavisor connection string by default, simplifying setup for developers.

This feature is particularly valuable for teams looking to optimize their database interactions and ensure robust performance as their applications scale.
