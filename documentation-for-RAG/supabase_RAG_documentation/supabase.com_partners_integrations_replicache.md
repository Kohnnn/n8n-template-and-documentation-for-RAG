## Overview

Replicache is a JavaScript framework for building high performance, collaborative, offline-first web apps.

We were inspired by apps like [Linear](https://linear.app/) and [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/). When the user takes an action in one of these apps, it happens instantly, with no server round-trip, and changes from other users appear in realtime.

Replicache works with Supabase Storage and Realtime Broadcast for its [poke message feature](https://doc.replicache.dev/byob/poke).
