Happy 2022. We're looking forward to a year of shipping product and helping our users build great things!

Here's a bunch of stuff we shipped throughout December...

## Hackathon Winners [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2021\#hackathon-winners)

## New crypto extension - pg\_crypto [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-beta-december-2021\#new-crypto-extension---pg_crypto)

We just added pg\_sodium as an extension inside all postgres instances.
Which means you can easily do encryption, decryption, hashing, and cryptographic signing from within your postgres functions and queries.
Enable it from the Database > Extensions tab in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
