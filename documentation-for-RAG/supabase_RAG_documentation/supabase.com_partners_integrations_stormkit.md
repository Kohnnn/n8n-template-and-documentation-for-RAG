## Overview

Effortlessly launch your full-stack JavaScript application within minutes and shift your focus to what matters most, your application itself. Leverage our powerful suite of tools to enhance your development process.

We offer a seamless process - build, host, and deploy in minutes, allowing you to channel your energy into solving user problems, not infrastructure management.

Managing your full-stack application infrastructure is as easy as 1-2-3:

1. Connect your repo using GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab to get started instantly.
2. Customize build configurations effortlessly.
3. Deploy automatically or with a single click and go live.

Our platform offers a range of features including built-in CI, staged rollouts, comprehensive logs, SSR, API functions, custom storage, and support for custom domains & SSL, among others.

Stormkit harnesses the power of AWS infrastructure, ensuring a robust environment for your JavaScript applications. We support popular frameworks like Angular, ReactJs, Node, Vue, Nuxt, Next, Nest, Svelte, and more.
