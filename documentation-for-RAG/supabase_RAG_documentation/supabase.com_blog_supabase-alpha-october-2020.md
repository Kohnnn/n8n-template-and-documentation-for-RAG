We're now 8 months into building Supabase. We're focused on performance, stability, and reliability but that hasn't prevented us from shipping some great features.

### Supabase.js 1.0 [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020\#supabasejs-10)

In the lead-up to our Beta launch, we've [released](https://supabase.com/blog/improved-dx) `supabase-js` version 1.0 and it comes with some major Developer Experience improvements. We received a lot of feedback from the community and we've incorporated it into our client libraries for our 1.0 release.

Check out the [blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/improved-dx) to learn more.

### More powerful SQL Editor [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020\#more-powerful-sql-editor)

Although it was only intended to be a temporary feature, the SQL Editor has become one of the most useful features of Supabase. This month we decided to make give it some attention, adding Tabs and making it full-screen. This is the first of many updates, we've got some exciting things planned for the SQL Editor.

![This image shows a SQL Editor with tabs. Originally our SQL editor was very basic, but we're moving towards something very powerful.](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fsql-editor.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

### Key commands for Power Users [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020\#key-commands-for-power-users)

For the heavy table editor users, we've gone ahead and added a bunch of key commands and keyboard shortcuts so you can zip around and manipulate your tables faster than ever.

![This image shows some of the keyboard shortcuts we introduced on the table editor.](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fkeyboard-shortcuts.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)

### Magic Links [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020\#magic-links)

One of the most requested Auth features was the ability to send magic links that your users can use to log in. You can use this with new or existing users, and alongside passwords or stand alone.

![This image shows a template where developers can edit the magic links email which is sent to their users on sign up.](https://supabase.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Fmagic-links.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_7FY8EmFQ6G3YqautJ4Fvh1viLnvu)
