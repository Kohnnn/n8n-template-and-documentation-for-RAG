## Overview

DrapCode is a multi-purpose [no code web app builder](https://drapcode.com/no-code-development) that allows you to design, build and launch your web applications using the drag and drop feature. It allows you to connect pages to the CMS and bring dynamic data to them without coding.

You can also connect external applications using [APIs and plugins](https://drapcode.com/integrations) for external services to interact with other applications in real-time.
