# What's new in pg\_graphql 1.5.7 [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql-1-5-7\#whats-new-in-pg_graphql-157)

Since our [last check-in on pg\_graphql](https://supabase.com/blog/whats-new-in-pg-graphql-v1-2) there have been a few quality of life improvements worth calling out. A quick roundup of the key differences includes:

- Pagination via First/Offset
- Schema based multi-tenancy
- Filtering on array typed columns with `contains`, `containedBy` and `overlaps`

## First/Offset pagination [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql-1-5-7\#firstoffset-pagination)

Since the earliest days of pg\_graphql, [keyset pagination](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/api/#keyset-pagination) has been supported. Keyset pagination allows for paging forwards and backwards through a collection by specifying a number of records and the unique id of a record within the collection. For example:

`
{
blogCollection(
    first: 2,
    after: "Y3Vyc29yMQ=="
) {
...
}
`

to retrieve the first 2 records after the record with unique id `Y3Vyc29yMQ==` .

Starting in version `1.5.0` there is support for `offset` based pagination, which is based on skipping `offset` number of records before returning the results.

`
{
blogCollection(
    first: 2,
    offset: 5
) {
...
}
`

That is roughly equivalent to the SQL

`
select
    *
from
    blog
limit
    2
offset
    5
`

In general as offset values increase, the performance of the query will decrease. For that reason its important to use keyset pagination where possible.

## Performance schema based multi-tennancy [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql-1-5-7\#performance-schema-based-multi-tennancy)

pg\_graphql caches the database schema on first query and rebuilds that cache any time the schema changes. The cache key is a combination of the postgres role and the database schema's version number. Initially, the structure of all schemas was loaded for all roles, and table/column visibility was filtered down within `pg_graphql`.

In multi-tenant environments with 1 schema per tenant, that meant every time a tenant updated their schema, all tenants had to rebuild the cache. When the number of tenants gets large, that burdens the database if its under heavy load.

Following version `1.5.2` each tenant's cache only loads the schemas that they have `usage` permission for, which greatly reduces the query time in multi-tenant environments and the size of the schema cache. At time of writing this solution powers a project with >2200 tenants.

## Filtering array column types [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql-1-5-7\#filtering-array-column-types)

From `1.5.6` pg\_graphql has added `contains`, `containedBy`, `overlaps` filter operators for scalar array fields like `text[]` or `int[]`.

For example, given a table

`
create table blog (
id int primary key,
name text not null,
tags text[] not null,
created_at timestamp not null
);
`

the `tags` column with type `text[]` can be filtered on.

`
{
blogCollection(filter: { tags: { contains: ["tech", "innovation"] } }) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        tags
        createdAt
      }
    }
}
}
`

In this case, the result set is filtered to records where the `tags` column contains both `tech` and `innovation`.

## Roadmap [\#](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql-1-5-7\#roadmap)

The headline features we aim to launch in coming releases of pg\_graphql include support for:

- Insert on conflict / Upsert
- Nested inserts
