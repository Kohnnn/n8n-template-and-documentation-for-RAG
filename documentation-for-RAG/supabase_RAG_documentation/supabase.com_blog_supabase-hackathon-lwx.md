[Supabase Launch Week X](https://supabase.com/launch-week) is about to start and we're running an async hackathon alongside it.

The hackathon starts Friday 8th December at 09:00 am PT and ends Sunday 17th December at 11:59 pm PT. You can win extremely limited edition Launch Week swag and add your name to the Supabase Hackathon Hall of Fame.

For some inspiration check out all the [winners from previous hackathons](https://supabase.com/blog/tags/hackathon).

This is the perfect excuse to "Build in a weekend, scale to millions". Since you retain all the rights to your submissions, you can use the hackathon as a launch pad for your new Startup ideas, side-project, or indie hack.
