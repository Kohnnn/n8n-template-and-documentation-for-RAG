# Securing n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/overview/\#securing-n8n "Permanent link")

Securing your n8n instance can take several forms.

At a high level, you can:

- Conduct a [security audit](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/security-audit/) to identify security risks.
- [Set up SSL](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/set-up-ssl/) to enforce secure connections.
- [Set up Single Sign-On](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/set-up-sso/) for user account management.
- Use [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/two-factor-auth/) for your users.

More granularly, consider blocking or opting out of features or data collection you don't want:

- [Disable the public API](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/disable-public-api/) if you aren't using it.
- [Opt out of data collection](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/telemetry-opt-out/) of the anonymous data n8n collects automatically.
- [Block certain nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/) from being available to your users.
