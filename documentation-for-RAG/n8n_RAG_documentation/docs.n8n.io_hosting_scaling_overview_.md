# Scaling n8n [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview/\#scaling-n8n "Permanent link")

When running n8n at scale, with a large number of users, workflows, or executions, you need to change your n8n configuration to ensure good performance.

n8n can run in different [modes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) depending on your needs. The `queue` mode provides the best scalability. Refer to [Queue mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) for configuration details.

You can configure data saving and pruning to improve database performance. Refer to [Execution data](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/execution-data/) for details.
