If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** \> **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.
