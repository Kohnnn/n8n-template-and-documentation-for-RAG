# Environment variables overview [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/\#environment-variables-overview "Permanent link")

This section lists of environment variables that you can use to change n8n's configuration settings when self-hosting n8n.

File-based configuration

You can provide a [configuration file](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for n8n. You can also append `_FILE` to certain variables to provide their configuration in a separate file.
