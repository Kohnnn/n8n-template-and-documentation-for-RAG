# Credentials [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/\#credentials "Permanent link")

[Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#credential-n8n) are private pieces of information issued by apps and services to authenticate you as a user and allow you to connect and share information between the app or service and the n8n node.

Access the credentials UI by opening the left menu and selecting **Credentials**. n8n lists credentials you created on the **My credentials** tab. The **All credentials** tab shows all credentials you can use, included credentials shared with you by other users.

- [Create and edit credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/add-edit-credentials/).
- Learn about [credential sharing](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/credential-sharing/).
- Find information on setting up credentials for your services in the [credentials library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/).
