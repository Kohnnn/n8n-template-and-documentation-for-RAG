## Function [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/data/code/\#function "Permanent link")

A function is a block of code designed to perform a certain task. In n8n, you can write custom JavaScript or Python code snippets to add, remove, and update the data you receive from a node.

The [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node gives you access to the incoming data and you can manipulate it. With this node you can create any function you want using JavaScript code.
