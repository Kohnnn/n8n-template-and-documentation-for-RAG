# n8n public REST API [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/api/\#n8n-public-rest-api "Permanent link")

Feature availability

The n8n API isn't available during the free trial. Please upgrade to access this feature.

Using n8n's public [API](https://docs.n8n.io/glossary/#api), you can programmatically perform many of the same tasks as you can in the GUI. This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:

- How to [authenticate](https://docs.n8n.io/api/authentication/)
- [Paginating](https://docs.n8n.io/api/pagination/) results
- Using the [built-in API playground](https://docs.n8n.io/api/using-api-playground/) (self-hosted n8n only)
- [Endpoint reference](https://docs.n8n.io/api/api-reference/)

n8n provides an [n8n API node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.

## Learn about REST APIs [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/api/\#learn-about-rest-apis "Permanent link")

The API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:

- [KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs](https://support.knowledgeowl.com/help/working-with-apis): a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.
- [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.
- [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis): more detailed information about REST APIs.
- [MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview): REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.

Use the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)

Trying out the API in the [playground](https://docs.n8n.io/api/using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely.
