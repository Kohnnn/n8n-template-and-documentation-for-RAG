# Pushbullet node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pushbullet/\#pushbullet-node "Permanent link")

Use the Pushbullet node to automate work in Pushbullet, and integrate Pushbullet with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Pushbullet features, including creating, updating, deleting, and getting a push.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Pushbullet node supports and links to more resources.

## What to do if your operation isn't supported [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.pushbullet/\#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported "Permanent link")

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** \> **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.
