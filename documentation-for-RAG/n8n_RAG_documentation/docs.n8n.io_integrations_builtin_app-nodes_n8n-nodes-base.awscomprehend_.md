# AWS Comprehend node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.awscomprehend/\#aws-comprehend-node "Permanent link")

Use the AWS Comprehend node to automate work in AWS Comprehend, and integrate AWS Comprehend with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of AWS Comprehend features, including identifying and analyzing texts.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the AWS Comprehend node supports and links to more resources.

[Browse AWS Comprehend integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/aws-comprehend/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)

## What to do if your operation isn't supported [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.awscomprehend/\#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported "Permanent link")

If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.

You can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:

1. In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** \> **Predefined Credential Type**.
2. Select the service you want to connect to.
3. Select your credential.

Refer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.
