# Jenkins node [\#](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.jenkins/\#jenkins-node "Permanent link")

Use the Jenkins node to automate work in Jenkins, and integrate Jenkins with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of Jenkins features, including listing builds, managing instances, and creating and copying jobs.

On this page, you'll find a list of operations the Jenkins node supports and links to more resources.
