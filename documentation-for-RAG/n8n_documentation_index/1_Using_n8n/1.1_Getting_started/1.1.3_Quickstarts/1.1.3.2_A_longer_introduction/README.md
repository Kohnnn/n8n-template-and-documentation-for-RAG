# A Longer Introduction

This guide provides a more detailed walk-through of n8n's core features:

1. Set up n8n via your preferred installation method.
2. Create a two-node workflow:
   - **HTTP Request** node to fetch data from an external API.
   - **HTTP Response** node to return processed data.
3. Configure authentication and parameters on the HTTP Request node.
4. Connect nodes and execute the workflow.
5. Inspect execution logs and troubleshoot any issues.

This introduction covers basic node configuration, connecting nodes, and debugging workflows.
