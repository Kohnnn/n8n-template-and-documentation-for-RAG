BrowserQL Editor has a few features to help you throughout your work. From built-in documentation and history tracker, to exporting your queries into a number of coding languages.

## Global Settings [​](https://docs.browserless.io/browserql/using-the-ide/ide-features\#global-settings "Direct link to Global Settings")

In the Global Settings tab, you can define the following settings:

- **BrowserQL Endpoint**: Choose between one of the available BQL Endpoints.
- **API Token**: Your API token goes here. This value is required to successfully execute your queries.
- **Persist Headers**: Choose whether to save headers upon reloading. _We recommend only to enable this option if you trust the device_.
- **Show Results**: Choose between automatically show the results after executing a query or not.
- **Theme**: Adjust how the interface looks like, between light or darkmode.
- **Wait before close**: Define the amount of time to wait before closing the connection. This can help when waiting for interactions is necessary for example. Choose between waiting `10s`, `30s`, `60s` or `5m`.
- **Clear storage**: Remove all locally stored data and start fresh.

## Built-in Documentation [​](https://docs.browserless.io/browserql/using-the-ide/ide-features\#built-in-documentation "Direct link to Built-in Documentation")

BrowserQL Editor comes with a complete documentation of all available mutations, responses and schemas you can use when creating your queries. You can access it in the top-left corner of the IDE window.Navigate through mutations and schemas by clicking in each one, and use the search input at the top to find the desired information.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Example code

Each mutation in the Built-in Documentation presents a working example code to show you how the mutation works. Copy it, and try the query out to see what each BQL mutation can do.

## Query as Code [​](https://docs.browserless.io/browserql/using-the-ide/ide-features\#query-as-code "Direct link to Query as Code")

The **Export Query as Code** feature helps you to turn any of your queries into a number of available coding languages. You can open this option in the sidebar to the side of the code tab, as presented below, or with the `Shift+Ctrl+E` shortcut.
