To choose the right Browserless offering, it helps to understand their differences. The table below summarizes key features and capabilities of BrowserQL (BQL) vs Browserless BaaS v2 vs RESTful APIs:

| Feature/Capability | BrowserQL (BQL) | Browsers as a Service (v2) | REST APIs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Usage Paradigm | GraphQL queries (run via a cloud IDE or GraphQL endpoint) | Connect via WebSocket using Puppeteer/Playwright libraries | HTTP/HTTPS requests to specific endpoints |
| Primary Use-Case | Stealth web automation, bypassing bot detection and CAPTCHAs | Running custom automation scripts with familiar libraries | One-off tasks (PDF, screenshot, data extraction) via simple calls |
| Stealth Capabilities | Advanced (human-like behavior, CAPTCHA solving) | Basic (stealth mode parameter) | Basic (stealth parameter) |
| Flexibility | High (specialized automation language) | Highest (full browser control) | Limited (predefined endpoints) |
| Ease of Use | Medium (requires learning BQL) | Medium (requires knowledge of browser automation libraries) | Simplest (HTTP requests only) |
| Connection Method | HTTPS | WebSocket | HTTPS |
| Proxy Support | [Advanced (built-in residential)](https://docs.browserless.io/browserql/bot-detection/proxies) | [Yes (via parameters)](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/proxies) | [Yes (via parameters)](https://docs.browserless.io/baas/proxies) |
| Session Management | Yes (reconnect mutation) | Yes (with proper setup) | No (stateless) |

## When to Use Each API [​](https://docs.browserless.io/overview/comparison\#when-to-use-each-api "Direct link to When to Use Each API")

### BrowserQL [​](https://docs.browserless.io/overview/comparison\#browserql "Direct link to BrowserQL")

Best for scenarios requiring advanced bot detection bypass, such as:

- Sites with sophisticated bot detection systems
- When CAPTCHA solving is required
- When you need human-like browser behavior
- For stealth-first web automation

### BaaS v2 [​](https://docs.browserless.io/overview/comparison\#baas-v2 "Direct link to BaaS v2")

Ideal for general-purpose browser automation:

- When you have existing Puppeteer or Playwright code
- For scenarios where you need full browser control
- For complex multi-step workflows
- When you're comfortable with browser automation libraries

### REST APIs [​](https://docs.browserless.io/overview/comparison\#rest-apis "Direct link to REST APIs")

Perfect for simple, stateless operations:

- Taking screenshots
- Generating PDFs
- Basic content extraction
- When integration simplicity is the priority
- For one-off tasks that don't require maintaining state
