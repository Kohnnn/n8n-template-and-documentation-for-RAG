The Bot Detection section helps you understand and overcome anti-bot measures employed by modern websites. These pages cover accessing protected pages, submitting forms without triggering bot flags, solving various types of CAPTCHAs, handling two-factor authentication, reusing sessions through cookies, and utilizing proxies for enhanced anonymity.
