[Awesome use-case #4,510: How to get notified when Hetzner servers and products are available](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/awesome-use-case-4510-how-get-notified-when-hetzner-servers-and-products-are-available)





But the real heartbreak is when you are hunting for your dream Hetzner Dedicated Server only to find out that it's not available in your preferred architecture and that there's no good way to get alerts or notifications when Hetzner effectively "restock" that type of server.

Changedetection.io to the rescue - get notifications when Hetzner restock their server offers!

Another great feature of changedetection.io is that you can interact with websites to compare their content.



Often you need to enter in some search query or need to access a page that's only available from behind a login/password form.



Or maybe perform change detection from behind password protected websites?



_**Note: Â Only use this on websites where you have permission todo so, and always "recheck" with the maximum realistic time between rechecks, logging-in every minute could get you blocked from the site you are viewing.**_
