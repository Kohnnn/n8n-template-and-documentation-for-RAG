To initiate a SSL session, a client will send a SSL Client Hello packet following the TCP 3-way handshake. This packet and the way in which it is generated is dependant on packages and methods used when building the client application. The server, if accepting SSL connections, will respond with a SSL Server Hello packet that is formulated based on server-side libraries and configurations as well as details in the Client Hello. Because SSL negotiations are transmitted in the clear, it’s possible to fingerprint and identify client applications using the details in the SSL Client Hello packet."</strong></em><br><br><strong>"With JA3S it is possible to fingerprint the entire cryptographic negotiation between client and it's server by combining JA3 + JA3S. That is because servers will respond to different clients differently but will always respond to the same client the same."</strong></p></blockquote><p>We're not aware of an easy work-around for this case, however perhaps using a specialist proxy service or other could help, this espicially affects Puppeteer type browsers that are all shipped with similar SSL/chrome libraries</p><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>Browser fingerprinting in general</h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Anti-robot score importance: <strong>Medium</strong></em></p><p>There are many technologies here, for example some anti-robot services will attempt to detect the actual hardware you're running on and compare that against a database of known configurations, if it looks "weird" it will increase your robot rating</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The IP address that you're calling from</h3><p><em>Anti-robot score importance: <strong>Medium</strong></em></p><p><em>IP address</em> plays a fairly important role, many services such as Cloudflare protect their customers by rating the IP address you are calling from, if you are calling from a cheap data-centre proxy for example (the most common kind of paid proxy), they already know their IP ranges and will rate the possibility higher that you're a robot.</p><p>Use quality residential proxies, preferably via a "SOCKS" connection so that it does not relay to the remote end that you're even using a proxy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scraping behaviour in general</h3><p><em>Anti-robot score importance: <strong>Low</strong></em></p><p>With computing power being quite high and costs cheap, this is not as important as it used to be, but many services will block you if you scrape too many pages concurrently or too fast sequentially, always be a "good internet scraper" and limit your scraping methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Deny-at-start and allow-later</h3><p><em>Anti-robot score importance: <strong>Hard to say</strong></em></p><p>Some services assume EVERYONE is a robot, and block you at the start then use some fingerprinting to identify you going forwards, this is usually some kind of CAPTCHA or other process, then the browser is fingerprinted and you're allowed in there on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>
