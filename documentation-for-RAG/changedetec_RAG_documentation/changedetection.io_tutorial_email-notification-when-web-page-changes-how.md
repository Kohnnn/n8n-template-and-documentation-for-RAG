### How to Set Up Changedetection.io to Monitor a Web Page and Send Email Notifications

Changedetection.io is an excellent tool for monitoring changes to websites. Whether you're tracking stock prices, checking for product availability, or keeping an eye on any important web content, Changedetection.io can notify you when something changes. In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through how to set up a web page monitor and configure email notifications for any updates—all using the subscription version of Changedetection.io.

#### Step 1: Log In (or Sign Up)

To begin, visit the [changedetection front page](https://changedetection.io/) and either sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

- After signing in, you will be directed to your dashboard, where you can see all your monitored web pages (if you’ve already added any) or begin setting up new ones.
- If you just joined us, simply follow the instructions in the welcome email, the email will include the login information, passwords etc


#### Step 2: Configure the email address for notifications

Now that you are happily logged in, click **SETTINGS** in the top bar, and then the **NOTIFICATIONS** tab, by default we dont assume you will use email alerts because we  support 95+ other notification systems such as Discord, Slack, MS-Teams, etc, so now you can simply add your email address here.

Click the **"ADD EMAIL"** button (located below the " _Notification URL list_" box), and fill in the email address you wish to notification when the web page changes, click **OK**

Then click **SAVE**(at the bottom of the page)

**Tip:** Once you have added your email address, you can also click _**"Send test notification"**_ to send a test email, so that you can be sure that you entered your information correctly

#### Step 3: Add a New Web Page to Monitor

1. Back the home page (click the "changedetection.io" text on the top left to return anytime) Add the website page URL in the box under the _"Add a new change detection watch"_ text, in this example we're adding `https://mycompany.com/news`
2. Then click **"Watch"** This will add the webpage to your list of watched pages, the system will begin rechecking the page at the default intervals (but you can change this anytime)

We encourage you to explore the various settings and possibilities that can be achieved with changedetection.io, but in this tutorial we want to give you just the very easiest overview of how to start monitoring a webpage and receive alerts via email when ever a change to the website page occurs.

You can also click "EDIT" and explore other options such as the recheck interval time, the _Visual Selector_ for choosing which elements/parts of the web page to monitor and the _Browser Steps_ option for interacting with the page (such as logging in, performing searches etc), you can also choose to include a screenshot with the email.

All the best and have fun monitoring web pages for changes!

_**Update December 2024!**\-_ You can now also temporarily "Comment out" a notification, simply place a " `#`" before the address/notification, that way you can still store the notification for future use but it's not used / processed, see below :)

![Commented out, temporarily disabled web page change notification email address](https://changedetection.io/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image_92.png)

So for example " `#mailto://other@home.com`" is stored but never used, so it's easy to find it in the future if you wish to re-enable that notification, but `mailto://me@home.com` is always used when sending notifications of web page changes.
