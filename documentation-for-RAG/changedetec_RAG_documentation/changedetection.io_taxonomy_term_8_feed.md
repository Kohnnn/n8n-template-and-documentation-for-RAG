There are several reasons why Hetzner servers are often praised for their great service, Cost-effective pricing, robust infrastructure, multiple data-centres, incredible network performance and great customer service.</p><p>But the real heartbreak is when you are hunting for your dream <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver?">Hetzner Dedicated Server</a> only to find out that it's not available and that there's no good way to get alerts or notifications when Hetzner effectively "restock" that type of server.</p><p>Changedetection.io to the rescue :)</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_18.png" data-entity-uuid="7493c00b-6581-4032-8475-12dbc59234f6" data-entity-type="file" alt="Screenshot of Hetzner website as an example for change detection" width="780" height="585" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>How to get notifications or alerts when Hetzner servers are available to buy</h2><p>Fortunately, Hetzner are super internet-friendly and make it easy to copy the link to the filters, you will need this link, place this link into changedetection.io</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>First</strong></em>, search for your <strong>Dedicated Server </strong>at <strong>Hetzner</strong>, you should see a <em><strong>"No server found"</strong></em> message on the <em>Hetzner server listing page</em>, this may also work for other servers at Hetzner. In our example we searched for a AMD based server, at the time of writing this tutorial, there were no AMD based servers available.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Second</strong></em>, copy and paste the Filter URL into changedetection.io and hit <strong>Watch</strong></p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_19.png" data-entity-uuid="c804adbf-fc72-420e-9577-f9531708d012" data-entity-type="file" alt="Adding the website to the change detection monitoring list" width="938" height="212" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Third and final</strong></em>, that's it!</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_20.png" data-entity-uuid="01c3ba88-2ae0-4a51-9b22-5d447064e1de" data-entity-type="file" alt="List of websites ready for change monitoring" width="1055" height="187" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extra points!</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>And ofcourse, you can jump over to to the <strong>\[edit\]</strong> tab and setup your <strong>notifications</strong>, remember, changedetection.io is not just about sending an email, but more useful is to trigger a message to your <strong>Discord</strong> channel and let your whole team know that the server you guys are hunting for is now available at <strong>Hetzner</strong>!</p><p>And ofcourse, through the magic of Apprise, changedetection.io supports more than 80 different kinds of notifications, including Slack, MS Teams, RockChat and more. PLUS you can also attach a screenshot!</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_21.png" data-entity-uuid="fe784237-24b3-448c-89bd-97b56ded9272" data-entity-type="file" alt="Notifications for website change monitoring" width="1071" height="362" loading="lazy"><p>( See our docs links and tutorials for getting your Discord API link :) )</p><p><br><strong>Extra extra points!</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Want to be MORE specific? You can even use the <strong>Visual Selector</strong> or <strong>Browser Steps</strong> tabs to click on items, and/or specifically focus on parts of the page - ensuring you get only the relevant notifications when Hetzner update their product availability :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>thanks for reading!<br>&nbsp;</p></div>
