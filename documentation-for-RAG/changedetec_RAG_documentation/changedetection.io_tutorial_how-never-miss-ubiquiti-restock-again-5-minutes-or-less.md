**How to Never Miss a Ubiquiti Restock Again (in 5 Minutes or Less)**

If you've been trying to get your hands on Ubiquiti gear—like the Power Distribution Pro, Cloud Gateway Fiber, or that elusive Dream Machine Pro—you know the story: blink, and it's sold out. Hitting refresh all day just doesn’t cut it anymore. But there’s a smarter way to shop—and it takes less than five minutes to set up.

With **ChangeDetection.io's Restock and Price Detection mode**, you can monitor any Ubiquiti product page and get notified instantly when it _comes back in stoc_ k. No complicated setup, no fiddling with page elements—just copy the product link, enable restock mode, and you're covered.

This guide will show you exactly how to do that. Whether you're new to this or already tracking a few items, you'll be up and running fast. And if you're serious about not missing restocks, you might want to consider upgrading—faster checks mean you're first in line when stock drops.

With a bonus at the end - How to connect all of this to your favourite Discord channel

Let’s get started.

_**First, grab a**_ [_**quick cheap subscription**_](https://changedetection.io/checkout) _**or**_ [_**install the changedetection.io software locally**_](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io) _**, in the case you grab a subscription you can be up and running in just a few seconds.**_

So let's go!

## Step 1.  Add the link to the item you want restock or price changes for from the UI Ubiquity store

There's two ways todo this, both are super easy, first way is to  add the URL directly to dashboard

Enter the URL of the product that you wish to monitor for restock or price change alerts directly in the dashboard

![Ubiquity add restock URL](https://changedetection.io/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image_115.png)

**Or** simply click on the browser extension to add the current product to your changedetection.io automatically  [using the browser extension - simply set "restock" mode](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/changedetectionio-website/kefcfmgmlhmankjmnbijimhofdjekbop)

Your browser does not support the video tag.


## Step 2. Your favorite Ubiquity products are now monitored for restock / back in stock and price changes.

Back at your dashboard you can now see the status of all the products you're interested in, Green for "in stock" grey for "out of stock", as well as price.

Changedetection.io will recheck the items based on any schedule you prefer, you can even limit it by days of the week, hours of the day.

### Step 3 - Optionally set price conditions

This step is **completely optional** but if you prefer you can also limit the notifications of price / restock changes by whatever amount you like, so you could perhaps limit the notification to price drops on Ubiquity products (Set the "Threshold % change" box)

Or an absolute price, perhaps you want to know if the product drops to below $10 when it's normally $12. (Discount / end of product line / special sales notifications)

## Step 4 - Setup your notifications including email, Discord and many others

One of the best parts of using ChangeDetection.io is how it supports **virtually every notification service you can think of**—thanks to its integration with Apprise. Whether you want alerts on **Discord**, **SMS**, **Telegram**, **Slack**, **Microsoft Teams**, **Pushover**, **Gotify**, or even **email**, it’s all built in and ready to go. You can set it up to ping your phone, your team, or even your smart home system the instant something changes. No more FOMO—just instant, reliable alerts exactly where you want them. Whether you're at your desk or on the go, you’ll never miss a restock again.

Head on over to the **"Notifications"**  and setup which ever you prefer for you and your team!
