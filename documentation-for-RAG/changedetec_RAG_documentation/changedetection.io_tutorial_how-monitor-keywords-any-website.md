## **How to Use Changedetection.io to Monitor Specific Keywords**

![](https://changedetection.io/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/keyword.png)

In the world of breaking news and rapid financial updates, staying ahead of key developments is critical. Changedetection.io helps you to get **notifications of specific keywords** on just about any webpageâ€”whether it's a news outlet, financial report, or investor relations page. Get instant alerts when important terms appear, such as company names, stock tickers, or economic indicators, so you never miss a crucial update.

_**With changedetection.io you can monitor thousands of web pages for important keywords.**_

### Step 1: Add the URL to your changedetection.io dashboard

Simply copy and paste the URL of the page you wish to monitor for keywords, then click **EDIT > WATCH**, this will take us directly to the page to add the keywords

### Step 2: Add the keywords to monitor - this will create a trigger for alerts

Click on **Filters & Triggers** and scroll down to " **Keyword triggers**", here you can setup the keywords to trigger on, they will be processed case-insensitive.

Super easy! Now every time the web page is checked (even according to your custom schedule if you prefer!) the text content will be compared against your list of keywords, if those keywords are found in the text of the webpage, and there was a change in the webpage, you will get a notification!

Be sure to click on the **Notifications** tab and configure your favourite alerts, don't forget we support email, Discord, Slack, MS-Teams and 85+ others! The best way to keep your team informed.

### Step 3: Sit back and relax, let changedetection.io do the work!

### Extra points

What if you want to monitor keywords on a webpage every day at 0900? [You could use the scheduler and combine it with your keyword alert](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/checking-web-pages-changes-according-schedule)

From here you can also get more advanced and setup [Conditions](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/conditional-actions-web-page-changes), (perhaps you want to also add a rule that the page should NOT include certain keywords at the same time, the possibilities are endless!)

Take it even further with **Group Watches**, you could even assign hundreds of web-pages to the same **Group** and then simply add the **Keywords to Monitor** as a single **Group** setting, saving you time and making it a lot easier to manage large lists of web-pages that should be checked for the same keywords.

I encourage you to check it out, have a play, and see just what is possible with **Web Page Keyword Monitoring** with changedetection.io

All the best, have fun, and happy changedetecting!
