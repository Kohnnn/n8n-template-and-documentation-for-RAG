[Website content change detection from behind logins - easy](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/website-content-change-detection-behind-logins-easy)







Another great feature of changedetection.io is that you can interact with websites to compare their content.



Often you need to enter in some search query or need to access a page that's only available from behind a login/password form.



Or maybe perform change detection from behind password protected websites?



_**Note: Â Only use this on websites where you have permission todo so, and always "recheck" with the maximum realistic time between rechecks, logging-in every minute could get you blocked from the site you are viewing.**_
