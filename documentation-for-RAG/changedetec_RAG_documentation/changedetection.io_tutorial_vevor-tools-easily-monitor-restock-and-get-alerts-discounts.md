[How-To](https://changedetection.io/topic/how)

If you're a fan of [Vevor tools](https://vevor.com/), you can buy them directly from their website. But even better than that is catching those irresistible clearance sales, restocks, and deep discounts on their products.

With changedetection.io, you can effortlessly set up alerts for price drops and restocks, ensuring you never miss a deal or the chance to grab a tool as soon as it's back in stock.

## How to setup alerts when a Vevor Tools product changes price or has a discount.

**Step 1:** Copy+Paste the link (URL) to the [Vevor Tools](https://vevor.com/) page you want to monitor and select "Re-stock & Price detection for single product pages".

Import is to select the **"Re-stock & Price detection for single product pages"** option, this will turn on the various options for following the product price (Such as being able to set limits/thresholds on the price of the product before sending a notification)

**Step 2**: Congratulations! By default, changedetection.io will automatically track any price or restock changes on the Vevor tools product URLs you've added. You can see this in the _"Restock & Price"_ column.

### How to setup notifications for discounts of the Vevor tools products and score a bargain?

Simply click **\[EDIT\]** at the list of website watches for the page/product you're interested in, then click **"Restock & Price Detection",** over on this tab is where you can setup alerts based on ;

- Price below $/GBP/EUR (If it goes OVER a certain amount, send alert)
- Price lower $/GBP/EUR (If it goes UNDER a certain amount, send alert)
- Price change by % - Probably the best option, for example you could get an alert if the Vevor product you're interested in goes on sale by more than 5% since the first check.

Perfect!

### How to add Email or Discord notifications to Vevor Tools product price discounts and restocks?

Probably our most asked question, fortunately it's exactly the same as setting up notifications for any other Â web-page change alert. Fortunately it's super simple, just click the \[ **Notifications\]** tab (available on each web-page watch, or under "Settings" to only set it up once for all watches)

Then click **"Add email" ,** it will ask you what email address you prefer and fill in the details automatically for you.
