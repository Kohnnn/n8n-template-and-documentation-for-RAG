Hitting refresh all day just doesn’t cut it anymore. But there’s a smarter way to shop—and it takes less than five minutes to set up.</p><p>With <strong>ChangeDetection.io's Restock and Price Detection mode</strong>, you can monitor any Ubiquiti product page and get notified instantly when it <em>comes back in stoc</em>k. No complicated setup, no fiddling with page elements—just copy the product link, enable restock mode, and you're covered.</p><p>This guide will show you exactly how to do that. Whether you're new to this or already tracking a few items, you'll be up and running fast. And if you're serious about not missing restocks, you might want to consider upgrading—faster checks mean you're first in line when stock drops.</p><p>With a bonus at the end - How to connect all of this to your favourite Discord channel</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>First, grab a </strong></em><a href="https://changedetection.io/checkout"><em><strong>quick cheap subscription</strong></em></a><em><strong> or </strong></em><a href="https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io"><em><strong>install the changedetection.io software locally</strong></em></a><em><strong>, in the case you grab a subscription you can be up and running in just a few seconds.</strong></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not convinced? check out what other people are saying about <em><strong>changedetection.io for ubiquiti store &nbsp;restock detection</strong></em>!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1js4s7l/thanks\_changedetectionio/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1js4s7l/thanks\_changedetectionio/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1hs6kzk/a\_better\_way\_for\_me\_to\_get\_instock\_alerts\_follow/?tl=pt-pt">https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1hs6kzk/a\_better\_way\_for\_me\_to\_get\_instock\_alerts\_follow/</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let's go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 1. &nbsp;Add the link to the item you want restock or price changes for from the UI Ubiquity store</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There's two ways todo this, both are super easy, first way is to &nbsp;add the URL directly to dashboard</p><p>Enter the URL of the product that you wish to monitor for restock or price change alerts directly in the dashboard</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_115.png" data-entity-uuid="1f53c487-ab3a-485e-9fdd-5914f62af3fa" data-entity-type="file" alt="Ubiquity add restock URL" width="796" height="466" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Or</strong> simply click on the browser extension to add the current product to your changedetection.io automatically &nbsp;<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/changedetectionio-website/kefcfmgmlhmankjmnbijimhofdjekbop">using the browser extension - simply set "restock" mode</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><video style="max-width:80%;" autoplay loop muted playsinline controls>

 <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field\_\_item"><p>Using a proxy scanner to determine which proxies can bypass <strong>403 Access Denied</strong> errors is crucial when monitoring websites for product prices or other changes with tools like Changedetection.io. Some websites restrict access based on geographic location or traffic patterns, leading to blocked requests and incomplete monitoring. A proxy scanner helps identify working proxies that successfully retrieve pages without being denied, ensuring consistent access to accurate data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately changedetection.io has a <strong>proxy scanner</strong> built in - so take for example this common situation where we have a few proxies configured but we get the error <strong>403 access denied</strong> on our default proxy</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_119.png" data-entity-uuid="e8869e6c-2acb-448b-8cfe-dc1698031ae0" data-entity-type="file" alt="403 access denied" width="1020" height="167" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we jump over to <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; then <strong>Requests</strong> tab we can then find the <strong>Proxy Scanner tool</strong> which will help us find the proxy (or location) that will let us by-pass the 403 Access Denied error.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First you need to add your proxies</strong></p><p>Jump on over to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>CAPTCHA &amp; Proxies</strong> and add your "Extra proxies", in the hosted/subscription version we call these "locations" however they are the same thing.

 <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field\_\_item"><p>Starting with version <strong>v0.49.9</strong>, Changedetection.io introduces one of its most powerful features yet: <strong>conditional actions</strong>. This opens the door to much more precise and flexible monitoring.</p><p>It’s no longer just about detecting when content changes — now you can define exactly <em>what kind</em> of change matters to you. For example, trigger an alert only when a product’s price drops below a certain threshold, or when a keyword appears in the updated content.</p><p>With full support for logic operators, you can create rich, rule-based conditions using logic like “greater than,” “less than,”, "contains", "not contains" and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So let's get on with a really great example - Monitor when temperatures in Berlin are "extreme" (less than -20c or greater than +38c)<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Let's add the web page we want to monitor for changes (Berlin Weather)</h3><p><br><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_109.png" data-entity-uuid="70cd2519-a0cb-47e8-b459-07f339b8bf95" data-entity-type="file" alt="Web page for conditional actions" width="955" height="245" loading="lazy"><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Let's set-up our conditional change detection filter</h3><p>Let the page fetch, then click <strong>\[EDIT\]</strong></p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_112.png" data-entity-uuid="ff7487bd-51cb-4608-ab07-4aaa33cf9b64" data-entity-type="file" width="893" height="319" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, using the <strong>Visual Filter Selector</strong> tab, choose the number, in this case we will click on the current temperature, a balmy 9.2°C. &nbsp;When the element is selected and click a <strong>red border</strong> will appear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to choose the right part of the web-page for change-detection, otherwise the number extractor wont know exactly which number is important to you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_113.png" data-entity-uuid="f3edea26-f116-407c-91f6-8dc7b2222391" data-entity-type="file" alt="Web page for conditional actions, setting the actual content" width="1097" height="601" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, hop on over to the <strong>CONDITIONS </strong>tab</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_114.png" data-entity-uuid="7572885f-f21d-434d-8cc1-dcc3fabf5fa0" data-entity-type="file" alt="Setting up rules / conditions for web page changes" width="977" height="433" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let's explain a little what we see here</p><ul><li><strong>"Match any of the following" - </strong>This acts as 'OR', so <em>any</em> rule will trigger on change</li><li><strong>"Extracted number after 'Filters &amp; Triggers" </strong>- We only want to look for a number inside of any filters we specified (This could be the Visual Selector, Text filters from other tabs etc)</li><li>Using these two buttons we can then <strong>add an extra</strong> <strong>\[ &nbsp;+ &nbsp;\]</strong> &nbsp;rule after this one, or <strong>remove it &nbsp; &nbsp;\[ &nbsp;- &nbsp;\]</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5><em><strong>Testing the rules!</strong></em></h5><p>Since the page is already fetched, It's nice to know if the rule currently will pass or fail, for this we can press the "tick" button, this will verify that rule row only and report if it PASSES or FAILS.</p><p>If you look closely you can see that after pressing the "verify" tick button you can see the text <strong>"extracted number value was 9.2"</strong> below the rules, this lets us know what the situation is and so we know if the right value is being extracted</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h5>Other interesting checks</h5><ul><li>Text contains (or does not contain)</li><li>Text length is greater than (or shorter than)</li><li>Text begins with (or doesnt begin with)</li><li>Text equal (or does not equal)</li><li>plus more!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Wrapping up</h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course now you can head over to the <strong>Notifications</strong> tab and setup your slack, email, discord or which ever format you and your team love the most.</p><p>This is how you can simply setup Conditional changes, this is just a simple example but there are so many other amazing ways to use this functionality, we encourage you to explore and play with this new tool :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>

 <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field\_\_item"><p>The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are finally here, and they are absolute game-changers! Powered by the revolutionary Blackwell RTX architecture, these GPUs deliver mind-blowing performance, doubling frame rates, slashing workflow times in creative apps, and supercharging AI generation.<img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_103.png" data-entity-uuid="20dd0b19-5a1e-4914-b4a7-57991cc8a683" data-entity-type="file" width="320" height="247" class="align-right" loading="lazy"> With DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation, you can experience ultra-smooth, ray-traced 4K gaming at unprecedented frame rates—think <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> maxed out at 290 FPS and <em>Alan Wake 2</em> at 230 FPS. Whether you're gaming, streaming, or pushing the limits of creative work, the RTX 50 Series is built for the future.</p><p>But here’s the catch—these cards are selling out <strong>fast</strong>! With stock-clocked and factory-overclocked models from ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, and more, plus limited Founders Edition cards from Best Buy, demand is through the roof. If you don’t want to miss out, <strong>Changedetection.io</strong> is your secret weapon. Set up instant restock alerts so you can grab one the moment it becomes available. Don’t get left behind—stay ahead of the crowd and secure your RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 before they vanish!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here's how!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 1. Setup your changedetection.io account</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simply register here (click signup) or deploy your own locally run software, see <a href>https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 2. &nbsp;Visit the product page page at BestBuy</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example <a href>https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32gb-gddr7-graphics-card-dark-gun-metal/6614151.p?skuId=6614151</a></p><p>This link is what you will use to "watch" in changedetection.io</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/bestbuy-geforce-rtx.jpg" data-entity-uuid="b1650c5a-59e4-4ae7-b7c1-19965f20850a" data-entity-type="file" alt="Bestbuy restock RTX" width="1111" height="733" loading="lazy"><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Step 3. &nbsp;Use the link in changedetection.io and set the restock mode!</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Be sure to set the "<strong> Re-stock &amp; Price detection for single product pages " </strong>mode for restock magic!</p><p>&nbsp;</p></li></ul><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_101.png" data-entity-uuid="ca67fa09-ed01-4cb8-96de-0a668a0c2768" data-entity-type="file" alt="Add RTX BestBuy for restock monitoring" width="1091" height="305" loading="lazy"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Step 4. Setup your notifications</h3><p>By default, we don't assume that you prefer email as a notification - infact many people are using Discord, NTFY, MSTeams and other communication methods, so simply visit <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Notifications</strong> and follow the prompts :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Step 5. Enjoy restock monitoring of the GeForce RTX 5090 / 5080 product page!</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now changedetection.io will recheck the BestBuy RTX 5090 / 5080 page at a preset interval, you can add for example all of the RTX range and see which ones come back in stock - or which ones have a price change</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/image\_102.png" data-entity-uuid="00564dca-aab9-44f8-94ae-b1ec91d7a66b" data-entity-type="file" alt="BestBuy RTX" width="1255" height="554" loading="lazy"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the best and happy gaming with your new RTX 5090 / RTX 5080 !</p></div>

 <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field\_\_item"><p>Integrating proxies with Changedetection takes website monitoring to a professional level by addressing challenges like regional restrictions, IP bans, and task scalability. Here’s how <a href="https://www.webshare.io/">Webshare proxies</a> enhance Changedetection:</p><ul><li><strong>Access Geo-Restricted Websites: </strong>Webshare proxies allow you to bypass regional restrictions by routing your requests through servers in specific locations. For example, if a website is accessible only to users in the US, using a proxy with a US IP address enables Changedetection to monitor that site seamlessly. This feature is invaluable for tracking region-specific content like local promotions, regional news updates, or country-specific pricing changes.</li><li><strong>Avoid IP Restrictions:</strong> Monitoring websites often involves sending frequent or repetitive requests, which may lead to your IP address being flagged or blocked. Webshare proxies mitigate this risk by rotating IP addresses, simulating requests from different users. This approach reduces the likelihood of detection and ensures uninterrupted monitoring, even on sites with strict anti-scraping measures.</li><li><strong>Scale Monitoring Across Multiple Sites: </strong>Tracking multiple web pages simultaneously can overload a single IP address, triggering rate limits or temporary blocks. Webshare proxies distribute these requests across multiple IPs, allowing you to monitor a higher number of pages without disruptions.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Privacy and Security: </strong>Webshare proxies mask your actual IP address, providing an added layer of anonymity and safeguarding your monitoring activities. This protection is crucial when tracking sensitive content, such as competitor websites or exclusive data, where you don’t want your actions to be easily traceable.</li><li><strong>Improved Speed and Reliability: </strong>High-quality Webshare proxies often provide faster and more stable connections than your regular network. This reduces delays in fetching updates and ensures that Changedetection performs consistently, even under heavy monitoring workloads or network fluctuations.</li><li><strong>Ensure Legal and Ethical Compliance: </strong>Webshare proxies enable monitoring activities to comply with regional laws and website policies. By ensuring access through approved regional proxies or adhering to site-specific terms of use, you can conduct ethical monitoring without violating restrictions.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Proxy setup method for beginners</h2><p>When integrating Changedetection with Webshare proxies, we'll cover a general beginner-friendly proxy setup first, followed by an advanced setup using rotating proxies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Subscribe to Changedetection.io</h3><p>Begin by subscribing to <a href="https://changedetection.io/">Changedetection.io</a>. Once you’ve successfully created an account, you’ll receive your credentials via email. Use these credentials to login and launch the web application in your browser.</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/1-setup\_0.png" data-entity-uuid="d422f7da-0fd4-4ad6-a0e1-e4db6548e4ae" data-entity-type="file" alt="join and setup" width="1179" height="656" class="align-center" loading="lazy"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>2. Access the SETTINGS menu</h3><p>After logging in, navigate to the top menu bar and click on <strong>SETTINGS </strong>to access the configuration options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/2-settings.png" data-entity-uuid="043b3d23-99ea-4442-94b7-7ebe0e1fc026" data-entity-type="file" alt="access settings" width="1600" height="427" class="align-center" loading="lazy"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3. Select the CAPTCHA &amp; Proxies tab</h3><p>Within the settings menu, locate and click on the <strong>CAPTCHA &amp; Proxies</strong> tab. This section allows you to add and manage proxy configurations for your monitoring tasks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/3-select.png" data-entity-uuid="d5f15372-9581-474b-bcb6-c11b5a008433" data-entity-type="file" alt="Visit the proxies tab" width="1600" height="682" class="align-center" loading="lazy"><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>4. Webshare proxy credentials</h3><p>For Webshare proxies, <a href="https://www.webshare.io/?referral\_code=0yb98y7xwmku">sign up for the free plan</a> to access 10 free datacenter proxies. These proxies are shared, limited to 1GB of bandwidth per month, and include options for both rotating and static configurations. You’ll find the necessary proxy details (username, password, host, and port) in your Webshare account dashboard.</p><p>Next, we will cover instructions for two different types of proxies - residential and datacenter. Pick one whichever you have subscribed for. The free proxy server plan is using datacenter proxies.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>5. Configure residential proxies</h3><p>To configure residential proxies, enter the proxy URL in the recommended format:</p><p><strong>http://username:password@host:port</strong></p><p>For example:</p><p><strong>http://username:password@p.webshare.io:80</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><img src="/sites/changedetection.io/files/inline-images/5-proxies.png" data-entity-uuid="7e28e711-0758-4ff7-83ff-98b497be1c56" data-entity-type="file" alt="List of residential proxies for web page change detection" width="1061" height="810" loading="lazy"><p>‍</p><p>Replace username, password, host, and port with the details provided by Webshare. Once added, click <strong>Save </strong>to confirm the settings.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>6. Configure datacenter proxies</h3><p>To configure datacenter proxies, use the same URL format as above.
