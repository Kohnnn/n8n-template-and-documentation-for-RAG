Using Bright Data proxies with changedetection.io is super beneficial for accessing web pages from different countries and bypassing blocking rules for several reasons:

1. **Geographical Location**: Proxies allow you to route your web requests through servers located in different countries. By doing so, you can effectively appear as if you are accessing the web from that specific country. This is useful for accessing geo-restricted content or services that are only available to users in certain regions.
2. **Bypassing IP Restrictions**: Some websites implement IP-based restrictions to limit access to their content or prevent excessive requests from the same IP address. Proxies help you overcome these restrictions by changing your IP address, so you can access the website as if you were coming from a different IP.
3. **Overcoming Censorship**: In regions with strict internet censorship, certain websites and online services may be blocked by the government or internet service providers. Proxies can help users bypass such censorship and access blocked content.
4. **Anonymity and Privacy**: Proxies provide an extra layer of anonymity by masking your original IP address. This can be valuable for users who want to protect their online privacy and avoid being tracked by websites or third parties.
5. **Load Distribution**: When accessing websites through proxies, the load is distributed across multiple servers. This can help prevent server overload and improve the overall performance and speed of web scraping or data collection activities.
6. **Scalability**: Proxies allow you to scale your web scraping or data collection efforts by making multiple requests from different IP addresses. This helps avoid getting blocked by websites that have rate-limiting or anti-scraping measures in place.
7. **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Proxies can be used to access websites in a manner that is compliant with their terms of service and legal regulations. By rotating IP addresses and not overloading servers, you can ensure responsible data collection practices.
